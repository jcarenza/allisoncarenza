<p style="text-align: center;">This is my first post on my brand new blog!  I have to admit I don&apos;t really like learning yet another program, but it&apos;s like a new phone after awhile it feels like home.  The following pictures are of two of the most beautiful babies ever!  Below is Easton, and I know this is a severe crop, but I love it because it&apos;s all about the eyes.  Please enjoy viewing the photos and feel free to leave a comment, I would love your feedback!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Just playing with his belly button!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369" title="el6" src="/media/el6.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="400" srcset="/media/el6.jpg 601w, /media/el6-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He&apos;s like seriously guys, enough is enough!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-368" title="el7" src="/media/el7.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" srcset="/media/el7.jpg 400w, /media/el7-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is a picture of Cole.  Cole was such a great 5 year old.  He was willing to do everything I asked and then some.  I&apos;m not really sure what he&apos;s doing here, but I&apos;m really sure it&apos;s pretty cute.  If you look closely at Cole&apos;s eyes he&apos;s got two different colors in there.  I might have to post some more of him later so you can get a close up.  What a great kid!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-371" title="el4" src="/media/el4.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="400" srcset="/media/el4.jpg 601w, /media/el4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And then there is Andrea with her boys.  I love this pic, Cole is so perfect, and Easton is so whatever I&apos;m a baby and cute what else do you want.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-372" title="el3" src="/media/el3.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" srcset="/media/el3.jpg 400w, /media/el3-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ok this picture is my favorite.  Andrea and I put the boys in the chair and told them to look cute when I went to get my camera I realized Cole had his finger over his nose.  When we asked what&apos;s up, he told us &#8220;he&apos;s stinky&#8221;  with a big grin.  LOVE IT!!!  Of course we told him it was fine and got the shot before changing Easton.  The others were more ideal, but I like this one more because it shows just how tolerant Easton is.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-370" title="el5" src="/media/el5.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="/media/el5.jpg 600w, /media/el5-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">And then there is some momma love.  Andrea is such a loving mommy.  I can tell her boys are her life, and she loves everything about them, even whey they&apos;re stinky because my goodness most of the time they look like this. Who can resist this face?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367" title="el8" src="/media/el8.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="/media/el8.jpg 600w, /media/el8-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Andrea thank you so much for picking me to capture your boys and all their faces.  I had so much fun and I look forward many more shoots.</p>
