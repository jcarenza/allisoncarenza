<p style="text-align: center;">It doesn&#8217;t happen often, but lately it seems the baby gods have blessed me with the most wonderful newborns in the world. Â Seriously floppy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Little Alex was no exception. Â No wait, he was the exception. Â Exceptionally perfect!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3137" title="ale1" src="/media/ale1.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" srcset="/media/ale1.jpg 750w, /media/ale1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Maybe it&#8217;s the fact that he came early. Â A week early to be exact. Â We actually took these pictures on his due date. Â During what started out as a routine visit for his mom Danielle turned into an emergency c-section, when they couldn&#8217;t find his heartbeat for 30 minutes. Â And he wasn&#8217;t moving. Â They offered to let Danielle deliver naturally right then, but she quickly refused and opted for the c- section. Â She was feeling the gravity of the situation, and with good reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Even though he was born with the cord around his neck he was also absolutely healthy! Â False alarm. Â ðŸ™‚</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3139" title="ale3" src="/media/ale3.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" srcset="/media/ale3.jpg 750w, /media/ale3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He even threw in a few smiles for me! Â Unbelievable!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3142" title="ale6" src="/media/ale6.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" srcset="/media/ale6.jpg 750w, /media/ale6-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Check out those back wrinkles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3141" title="ale5" src="/media/ale5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" srcset="/media/ale5.jpg 750w, /media/ale5-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We moved him from here to there and never without a peep. Â Danielle hadn&#8217;t fed him in hours and we didn&#8217;t even fed him once during the shoot. Â In fact we barely had to change his diaper. Â I&#8217;m starting to think I need all babies a week early! Â LOVE!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3138" title="ale2" src="/media/ale2.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" srcset="/media/ale2.jpg 750w, /media/ale2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3140" title="ale4" src="/media/ale4.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="499" srcset="/media/ale4.jpg 751w, /media/ale4-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">All my hats were a touch big, but still adorable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3143" title="ale7" src="/media/ale7.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="499" srcset="/media/ale7.jpg 751w, /media/ale7-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Since Danielle can&#8217;t drive for a couple weeks I went to her for this shoot and it was so much fun! Â I&#8217;m so looking forward to meeting the rest of the family in a couple months! Â Danielle you are so much fun!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
