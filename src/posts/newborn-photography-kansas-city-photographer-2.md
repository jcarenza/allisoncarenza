<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Jax!  I love the name, and the baby, and the family!!!!  And I really loved taking his newborn pictures!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2885" title="j2" src="/media/j24.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="500" srcset="/media/j24.jpg 743w, /media/j24-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jax was wide awake most of the shoot.  But just when we were about to wrap things up, he dozed off.  His mom Brandy and I sat on the floor and pulled all the stops trying to get him to close those little eyeballs.  He fought it to the bitter end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I cherish those quiet moments with my clients when the camera isn&apos;t in front of my face.  I really get to know them.  I learned a lot about the Martin family during our shoot.  Like Jon and I, Jeff and Brandy are career driven.  They didn&apos;t start their family until later when their world was established.  And Brandy started to get the bug.  Jeff owns <a href="http://www.smallcakeskc.com/">Smallcakes</a> You can find them on f<a href="http://www.facebook.com/SmallcakesKC">acebook</a>.  These little cakes are like a bit of heaven.  I would totally recommend trying one!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2888" title="j5" src="/media/j54.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="500" srcset="/media/j54.jpg 743w, /media/j54-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then there&apos;s Lily, just 2, but going on 12.  Seriously.  Brave, outgoing, talkative, and friendly.  While taking pics of Jax she would reandomly pop in front of me and say Hi...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So cute!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2887" title="j4" src="/media/j44.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="500" srcset="/media/j44.jpg 743w, /media/j44-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2890" title="j7" src="/media/j74.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="500" srcset="/media/j74.jpg 693w, /media/j74-300x216.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jax may of had trouble going to sleep, but he had no trouble being the perfect little model.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2889" title="j6" src="/media/j64.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="500" srcset="/media/j64.jpg 743w, /media/j64-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Absolutely perfect!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2884" title="j1" src="/media/j14.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="500" srcset="/media/j14.jpg 743w, /media/j14-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Taking pictures of newborns is probably one of the most challenging shoots I do, but also the most rewarding.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2886" title="j3" src="/media/j34.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="500" srcset="/media/j34.jpg 743w, /media/j34-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" />Jeff, Brandy, Lily, and Jax you are such a fun family!  I really enjoyed hangin with you!  I can&apos;t wait to do it again!</p>
