<p style="text-align: center;">Ryan was told by a family member that there was a hot girl at their work that he should come by and meet.  He was skeptical,  until he decided to give it a try, and saw Lindsey for the first time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ryan still looks at Lindsey like it&apos;s the first time.  He absolutely adores her, and the pictures show it.  They also show how giddy Lindsey gets when Ryan is around.  They are so very in love, obsessed even!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Lindsey was very uneasy about having her pictures taken, but I couldn&apos;t tell.  She was so beautiful!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Oh beautiful light!  We started our shoot in Loose park and ended in the west bottoms.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes I make couples practice dancing during our shoot, then I say funny things to get them to laugh.  We had a blast!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Lindsey and Ryan, I can&apos;t wait for your wedding in just a couple months!  It is going to be the most amazing day, and I feel so lucky to be the one there to capture it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
