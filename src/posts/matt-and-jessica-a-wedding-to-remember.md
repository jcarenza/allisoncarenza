<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Matt and Jessica booked me via Skype after an hour internet conversation where we laughed more than we talked, they decided I was the best photographer for their wedding day, and I decided I was going to document their joy because they seemed to have a lot of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We met in person for the first time the day before the wedding at <a href="http://www.thestanleyeventspace.com/">The Stanley</a> in Lees Summit.  It was like we&apos;d known each other forever.  And it became very obvious to me that the most important detail to Matt and Jessica was not in the details at all, but in the marriage, the vows, the I Do, the fact that tomorrow they were going to become one.  All the other stuff was just details.  In fact, they were unsure of a lot of the details, but that was just fine with me.  I reassured them that I am there to photograph the day, to capture the joy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Jessica is very close to her sisters and nieces and nephews.  This family needs to win an award for the best smiles ever.  Seriously!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Oh Jessica you rock!  Go on...work it!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">They adore their Aunt Jessica!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I noticed that Matt and Jessica&apos;s eyes would  light up when they were around each other.  Having said that.  I think in every relationship there&apos;s a trophy and an athlete.  Jessica is definitely Matt&apos;s trophy.  He adores her, he admires her, and he loves her with his whole heart.  I could see it in his eyes.  All. Day. Long. And Jessica just soaks it up, like his love is her oxygen that she needs, must have, to survive.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Somewhere in the wee hours of the night we climbed a ladder through a hole in the roof and got on top of the building.  It was more than cold, it was freezing, but we managed to click a few quick pics before going back to the party, and freezing our fingers off.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> LOVE!  These two were always right by each other.  So much love, so much affection.  They&apos;ve been together a long time, and I have no doubt it&apos;s just the beginning!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Congrats Jessica and Matt!  Here&apos;s to many more years of laughter and love!</p>
