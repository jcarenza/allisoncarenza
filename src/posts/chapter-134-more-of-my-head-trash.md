<p>Guilty!  I&apos;m guilty, I admit it, I&apos;m not proud, but I compare my work to that of other artisits.  Sometimes I think I&apos;m better, sometimes I know they&apos;re better.  It&apos;s such a natural human thing to do. I try really hard to compete only with myself, but we&apos;re surrounded with amazing photography, it&apos;s everywhere.  The digital camera has taken some of the novelty out of photography.  So I like need to get to the point, right?</p>
<p>My point.</p>
<p>Tuesday I took the day to hang with Cara at the pool.  Her last day of summer before the start of school, and I&apos;ll admit I needed a day off.  Anyway, she saw in my bag a professional photography magazine and said &#8220;oh that&apos;s a creepy picture&#8221;.  I immediately grabbed the magazine, curious.  I really value Cara&apos;s opinion. To my surprise it was a picture of a newborn.  Now I hate to pull this exact cover up because this photographer in my opinion is amazing.  But Cara thought it looked unnatural, awkward, and well...creepy.  It&apos;s kinda the style right now to take beautiful, sleepy, little newborns and put them in weird settings, and poses.  This particular baby was folded over itself with it&apos;s hands under it&apos;s head and it was smiling.  Now you know it wasn&apos;t really smiling, but the photographer was good and captured a moment.  So the point...I really need to focus on my style.  Get back to feeling the moment and capturing it.  Here I was trying to recreate that style, the &#8220;in&#8221; style, when I really needed to focus on what I&apos;m good at. Capturing the emotion.  Mostly between parents and their newborns.  Mostly love.  So if everyday has a lesson, today mine would be to love my work with the understanding that photography really is an art and everyone has a style.</p>
<p>Check out these pics and you&apos;ll see what I mean.  If these don&apos;t make you feel something you might need to go the ER right away for CPR.</p>
