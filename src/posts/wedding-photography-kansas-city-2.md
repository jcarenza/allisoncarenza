<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">This love started with a boy and a girl. Â A boy not sure of marriage, and a girl sure of love. Â And sure enough they found each other!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It wasn&apos;t coincidence, it wasn&apos;t by chance, it wasn&apos;t a random meeting at a bar, this relationship was fate. Â Let me explain. Â Amber is a teacher, and at parent teacher conferences one of her parents, Cheryl, tried to hook her up with her handsome cousin Sean. Â Amber was all no way, so of course she didn&apos;t pursue. Â Then a year later while coaching cross country, Cheryl again tried to convince Amber that dating her cousin was the best idea ever. Â Amber must have given in because Sean called her and they had a fateful first date. Â I guess the rest is history because after 5 years of fun, they are now married.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The day started flawlessly. Â A warm breeze in the air, blue skies, and Amber with all her besties getting ready for her big day.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The dress was perfect.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1251" title="2" src="/media/2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="750"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The flowers were perfect! Â This is the 3rd wedding I&apos;ve seen use <a href="http://http://www.hy-vee.com/">Hy-Vee</a> and each time the flowers have been this good!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1252" title="3" src="/media/3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="750"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Minus the fact that she had a few butterflies, Amber was perfect!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1253" title="4" src="/media/4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Her bridesmaids were gorgeous and ready.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1254" title="5" src="/media/5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Makeup and hair...Perfect! Â Thanks to Alecia and Shannon at Shag Salon.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">But then the skies went from blue to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">grey </span>black. Â And sheets of rain started coming down. Â While everyone followed the Doppler radar, I prayed to the rain gods. Amber wasn&apos;t so worried about the rainÂ because she knew at the end of the day she would be married to the man of her dreams, her best friend, Sean. Â  So while the rain poured down I headed to see Sean as he prepared for his big day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1256" title="7" src="/media/7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Just as we arrived at the chapel the Gods granted my request because the sun was out and there was a big blue sky. Â It was hot, sweaty, humid, did I mention it was horribly hot, but it wasn&apos;t raining. Â And the bride and groom were glowing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Amber and her momma are so close, so this is picture perfect.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The chapel was perfection! Â <a href="http://http://www.pilgrimchapel.org/">Pilgram Chapel</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">And as they exited there were bubbles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Typically the grooms are ready to get to the reception in a hurry, but Sean loves photography so we were able to get some fabulous pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">They are so in love that taking beautiful pictures on their wedding day was easy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1268" title="19" src="/media/19.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="400"   /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1276" title="27" src="/media/27.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"   /></p>
