<p style="text-align: center;">Lynn the owner of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/DizzliciousCreations/106159336120367?ref=ts&amp;sk=wall">Dizzlicious Creation</a>s came by today and made this dark gloomy day oh so much better!  She brought me a bag of loot for my newborn sessions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I just met Lynn a couple weeks ago, but I already love her for so many reasons.  #1 She&apos;s an artist through and through.  #2 She&apos;s so fast, and I&apos;m fast, so I kinda love fast people.  #3 She&apos;s affordable.  #4 She can make anything on etsy and then some.!  I love etsy, but I avoid it because it just gets me in trouble.   I find it&apos;s really hard to afford all the adorable stuff I want, and I want it all.  Lynn makes that possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Find something on etsy and drop Lynn an email, she&apos;ll make if for you!  dizzliciouscreations@gmail.com</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SO SO SO happy!!!!!  Below are just a few of the goodies she brought me.  I also got an owl hat, but I&apos;ll keep that one a surprise for later this week!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ooohh lala!</p>
