<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-567" title="k1" src="/media/k1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400 This is baby Nolan with his parents Carrie and Brian!  He is one adorable little guy.  He was so alert during our shoot he was all about having fun!  Looking everywhere including the camera.  We got so many great shots, but here are a few of my favorites.  I love his big laugh.  Brian was actually over my shoulder making a hilarious noise/face at him.  He just couldn&apos;t stop laughing.  This is one of many.  It&apos;s pretty funny what we&apos;ll do to get a good smile.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">And there there are those blue eyes.  Actually there are some cute little teeth in there too, but you can&apos;t see them in this picture.  What a fun baby.  I can&apos;t wait to capture some more of Nolan as he grows in his first year!</p>
