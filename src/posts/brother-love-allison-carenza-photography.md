<p style="text-align: center;">For 7 years is was just Chase and his parents.  And he loved it.  There was always a quiet part of him that hoped to have a sibling, but he soaked up his parents love like a sponge, and didn&apos;t complain.  Maybe that&apos;s what makes it so easy for him to love his new little brother Evan.  Of course there&apos;s a tiny part of him that is having a hard time sharing his parents, he&apos;s never had to.  But a much bigger part of him understands that this quiet, sleeping, sometimes crying, little baby, will grow up to be his best friend.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">These boys are outside, farm, cowboys.  I have no doubt Evan will be the same.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">And then at the end of the shoot Evan passed out.  Floppy baby style, so I played.  He was perfect!</p>
