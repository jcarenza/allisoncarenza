<p style="text-align: center;">Meet baby Allison! Â You might recognize the family, I&apos;ve been photographing them for 4 years. Â So you can imagine my excitement when Kim told me they named their new baby girl Allison. Â With 2 l&apos;s and everything! Â I&apos;m sure having that name will bring baby Allison plenty of good luck. Â I mean it&apos;s her pediatrician&apos;s name too!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3401" title="alli3" src="/media/alli3.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;ve gotten great joy out of watching Allison&apos;s older siblings grow up, with such different personalities, except when it comes to pictures. Â They both use to be oh so timid in front of the camera, scared even. Â Those times are gone, mostly in part because Kim likes to do lots of pictures and I&apos;ve become a permanent fixture in their family. Â ðŸ™‚</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Only time will tell how little Allison&apos;s personality will develop, but already I can tell she&apos;s laid back! Â In fact I&apos;m not sure she even noticed we were fiddling. Â She had one priority. Â Sleeping!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This was just after AllisonÂ pukedÂ all over the place. Â It took some convincing to get big brother to even come near her.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I love getting to watch my clients grow up before my camera, I love that I become a part of the family, like a second aunt. Â I love my job! Â I can&apos;t wait to do pictures again soon!</p>
