<p style="text-align: center;">I am giddy with big news!  Can you hear my smile?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> I am more than excited to introduce Victoria Howell!  The newest member of the AC photography team.  Victoria is a student at the International Art Institute of KC in Lenexa.  She graduates in March, with a bachelors degree in photography.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I love Victoria&apos;s amazing eye, I love her work ethic, I love how she interacts with kids, and their parents, I love that she understands that light is the most important aspect of photography, and I love that she is willing to learn and grow because deep down she wants to be the best.  Her best!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The fact that Victoria has oodles of natural talent in photography makes her a great fit,  but what I really love about her, is that she&apos;s a farm girl.  No really, she grew up in little, tiny, Syracuse, KS.  Her dad is a wheat farmer and she has 3 rowdy brothers, 1 older, and 2 younger.  She&apos;s pretty much a tomboy turned artist.  In the summers  she still goes home for a few weeks to help with Harvest.  Did I mention she drives a gigantic truck.  Yup!  My kind of girl!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Even though she loved her childhood, Victoria never had dreams of being a farmer like her dad.  In fact, when she was in school she wanted to be a Chemist, and then a pro golfer.  She competed at the collegiate level in golf, and she&apos;s really great.  But eventually she realized her passion was in photography, so she abandoned her first camera, a Looney Tunes camera that she got when she was nine to pursue her dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">However, convincing her dad that photography was a real job, was not so easy.  She had to make a spreadsheet with a business breakdown before he would support her decision to be an artist.  She&apos;s a smart girl, and her dad wanted her to be happy, so he agreed to help her with her college.  I&apos;m really impressed with Victoria&apos;s determination.  I wish I would have been brave enough to pursue my dream earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Victoria is currently assisting in shoots, helping with editing, and will soon be taking on some shoots of her own.  In fact.  On July 22nd we will be hosting a summer themed day of mini sessions.  Stay tuned for details.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Victoria!!!!</p>
