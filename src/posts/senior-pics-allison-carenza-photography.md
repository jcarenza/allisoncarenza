<p style="text-align: center;">She&apos;s smart, really smart, a rock star basketball player, and a devoted Christian.  Jordan is headed to KU this fall with one goal in mind...to change the world.  And I have no doubt she will.  Jordan isn&apos;t your typical senior girl.  She showed up to our shoot with her outfits tossed in a small athletic backpack.  I was shocked with her casual attitude, but the truth is she keeps it real, and has the maturity of someone twice her age.  At first I thought it might be that she wasn&apos;t that into the pics, but I was wrong.  Jordan brought it for me.  There were so many shots that were outstanding, but these  below really spoke to me.  Maybe they represent this serious, but happy senior.  I hope you enjoy.</p>
