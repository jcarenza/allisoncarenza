<p style="text-align: center;">Baby Love: A great song by The Supremes, but also the special way new parents feel about their new arrivals.  Baby Love.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Ainsley the proud baby of parents Jenni, and Joel.  Her parents have hard core baby love syndrome.  They are the definition of obsessed.  I don&apos;t think I need to say much about these newborn pictures, because the photos do their emotions justice.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I do want to say that Jenni is a gorgeous momma.  Red hair is my absolute favorite to photograph.  Perfection!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Funny story, Joel and I swam on the same swim team as kids.  He didn&apos;t know I was Allison McIntosh until he got to my house and we started taking pictures. Halfway through the shoot he made the connection and I remembered.  Pretty funny how things work out.  Joel was quite the swimmer as a kid now he&apos;s quite the daddy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Ok not my most perfect picture but I couldn&apos;t resist.  I just wished the bunny would have cooperated more.  He refused to look at little Ainsley.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Ainsley was such an easy baby to photograph.  Not sleepy, but definitely willing to let us take a pic of her pretty mug.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1387" title="joel2" src="/media/joel2.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I can&apos;t wait to see Ainsley grow up.  And I have no doubt her parents will always have baby love for her.</p>
