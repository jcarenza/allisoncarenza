<p style="text-align: center;">This happened in my studio this week!  Oh how I love my job.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Meet baby Amelia.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I don&apos;t have my own baby, but I sure love lovin&apos; on my clients littles!  Just look at those little lips and tiny toes!  So perfect!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I had no idea Easter was next week.  WHAT!  I guess we&apos;ll have to have some snow bunnies this year.  That would be a great pic!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Oh I love my job!  Can&apos;t say it enough!</p>
