<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Cori! Â She&apos;s a devoted momma, loving wife, and beautiful pregnant woman that I had the honor of photographing. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Cori didn&apos;t get her maternity pictures taken the first time around, so with this baby she was determined to make the maternity pictures happen, and she did! Â I&apos;m so happy she allowed me to be her photographer. Â We laughed, shared stories, and had an all around good time. Â And I was in heaven doing what I love. Â Thank you Cori, for letting me take your pictures, for being beautiful, for being you!</p>
