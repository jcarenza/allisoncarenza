<p style="text-align: center;">Today is the last day of July which is so very hard to believe.  This summer is going by way too fast.  I love summer, I mean I really love summer, and I don&apos;t want it to end.  So today I&apos;m thinking it&apos;s time to take a sec and think about the little moments.  The ones that really matter.  To show you what I mean I picked the Hendrickson family.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This is Abby and her newborn baby brother Bob.  I like to look at this picture because it makes me wonder what she&apos;s thinking.  I tried to guess, but it just didn&apos;t feel right.  So I&apos;ll leave those thoughts to you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This picture is all about the moments daddys share with their little girls.  There is such a special bond.  I was happy to capture this moment because truly Abby is her daddy&apos;s little girl.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Danielle is such a beautiful mom, she was a natural.  It can be frightening for new moms to bring their week old baby in for pics.  It&apos;s just downright stressful, but Danielle was born to be a mom, so it was easy.  Just as easy as it is for her to love her baby Bob.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I know it&apos;s my job to capture the faces of the people my clients want to remember.  I embrace the responsibility and cherish the opportunitiy to work with amazing people.  What I love about my job it capturing the moments.</p>
