<p style="text-align: center;">Danielle is such a stunning pregnant woman.  Being that she&apos;s a dancer her body moved and molded right into pregnancy with ease.  She was so much fun to work with.  It&apos;s always so inspiring to be around pregnant women.  They are so full of life and hope, and love.  I really can&apos;t find the words to describe the feel I get when I take maternity pics.  I love it!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The lines of pregnant women are perfect for art.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This was one of my favorite pics from the shoot.  I think it&apos;s so vogue.  Most the time I&apos;m really really really hard on my photos.  But, every now and then I fall in love with a photo and this is one of them.  I really wanted to use this for my Little Blue Art Fest booth, but just couldn&apos;t crop it to work.  Danielle thanks for being beautiful!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My favorite part of maternity blogs is announcing the arrival of a healthy baby!  Baby Bob is here and he came 2 weeks early!  I guess he was in a hurry to get started.  I&apos;l be taking Bob&apos;s pic next Monday and I can&apos;t wait!!!!  If he looks anything like his parents I&apos;m sure he&apos;s perfect!</p>
