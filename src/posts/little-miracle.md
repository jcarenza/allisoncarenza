<p style="text-align: center;">From the pictures Simon looks like your typical 3 month old, but maybe a little cuter. ðŸ™‚ Â The truth is he&#8217;s much more than a typical 3 month old, he&#8217;s a miracle. Â His parents Dustin and Allison got married and had big dreams of starting a family, it was what they had always wanted. Â So they started trying right away, but after a year with no luck, they reached out for help. The results were not good, Â the doctors told them they had a 2% chance of conceiving. Â They knew the odds were not in their favor but they couldn&#8217;t give up yet, so they tried everything, but after 4 years, and a failed in vitro attempt they decided to give up on their hopes and dreams of having their own baby. Â That next month Allison was more than surprised to find she was pregnant, with no fertility drugs, nothing, just a baby in her belly. Â  Miracles are real, and dreams really do come true!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I have been blessed knowing Allison and Dustin through their whole journey. Â Allison is so strong, and instead of getting down during the 4 years of trying, she decided to devote her energy into helping others with her same problem. Â She started the <a href="http://www.kansascityinfertilityawareness.com/">Kansas City Infertility Awareness Foundation</a>.Â For 3 years she&#8217;s been helping others cope with infertility, while dealing with her own problems. Â I know it&#8217;s cliche, but angels really are among us, and Allison is undoubtedly one of them.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Â You can&#8217;t begin to imagine the amount of love Allison has for Simon. Â I remember when she came by my house to pick up the gift certificate I was donating for her 2nd annual infertility awareness conference. Â She came in all smiles, but that wasn&#8217;t new, it was when she bursted out the news that she was pregnant, that I noticed she was glowing. Â She still has that glow and has ever since, even in those first weeks of sleepless nights.</p>
