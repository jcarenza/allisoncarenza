<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">When I meet a new client, there is always a level of anxiety that I try to mask with my smile and constant conversation.  I want the clients that come into my home, into my studio, to like me, feel comfortable with me, and most importantly I want to bring it for them.  I want my creative energy to be uber powerful, so I can turn out the best pictures for them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What I sometimes forget is that my clients are equally nervous.   They are coming to a strangers house, and being asked to get pretty much naked.  Geez, I thought I was nervous, but never having had this experience I can&apos;t imagine what my beloved clients must go through.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Rebecca was sent to me by her friend Pam who also just had a baby.  I knew Pam would only send me the coolest people in the world, and I was right.  Rebecca came in the studio nervous, but left a friend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We clicked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I think I even managed to get her hubby Mike to enjoy getting his pics taken.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">They haven&apos;t ever really had professional pics taken, but I would have never guessed that.  They look like models.  Adorable!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I didn&apos;t have to pull out many tricks for this shoot, all Julie wanted to do was sleep.  Alex her big sister was also so so awesome!</p>
