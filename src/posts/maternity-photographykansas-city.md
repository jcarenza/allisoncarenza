<p style="text-align: center;">I recently saw an article in a professional photographer&apos;s magazine about maternity pics.  First of all they were kinda creepy, too posed, and well just blah.  I love doing maternity pics and not to toot my own horn TOOT TOOT, but I think my maternity pics are some of the best!  I have to admit I&apos;m lucky because I work with tons of beautiful women like Carroll.  Beautiful, fun-loving couples that make it easy to capture their love.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Really Carroll can you be more gorgeous?  Brian you are one lucky guy.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1193" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1191/car2"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1193" title="car2" src="/media/car2.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="/media/car2.jpg 750w, /media/car2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I have to admit Carroll is lucky too.  Brian is obsessed with her, and their future baby.  I think they&apos;ll make a splendid team!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Thanks you two for being adorable, in love, and so easy to work with!  I couldn&apos;t even begin to pick the pics to share.</p>
