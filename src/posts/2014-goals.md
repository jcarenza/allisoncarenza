<p>This holiday season came and went in a flash!  Jon and I went to a ton of holiday parties, we spent time with family and friends, and also had a chance for some much needed lazy days.   I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s 2014.  Last year was amazing, and I feel like I grew so much as a person, but I think 2014 is going to be an even bigger year for the Carenza&apos;s!</p>
<p>Here is my reassess of my ongoing goals!</p>
<p><strong>Goals...some are ongoing and some are new.</strong></p>
<p>1. Grow my business.</p>
<p><strong>I guess I&apos;ll never be done working on this goal. </strong></p>
<p>2. I have an invention I&apos;m working on.  It&apos;s slow going, but one little step at a time.  I hope to have a working prototype this year.  We are going to take the Looky loo to the Market!</p>
<p><strong>The Looky Loo has come so far!  You can read all about my journey <a href="http://lookyloolight.com/">here</a>.  http://lookyloolight.com/   In July we won <a href="http://dreambigamerica.us/">Dream Big America</a>, and it&apos;s been non stop since then.  We decided to take Looky Loo one and make it even better so we went to a new electronics engineer at <a href="http://www.mjsdesigns.com/">MJS Designs</a>.  The team at MJS was amazing and we had a fantastic experience.  Now that the second prototype is done we are looking at local manufacturers to find the perfect teammate to take the looky loo to the next level!  We hope to launch our Kickstarter in February.  You can follow us on the site, or even better go out and like our page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LookyLooLight">here</a>.  There is so much momentum and excitement around the Looky Loo right now, I&apos;m excited to share the experience with you in 2014</strong></p>
<p>3. Get my new website launched.  We&apos;ve been working on it for about 6 months and it&apos;s going to be awesome.  I&apos;ll be sure to let you know when it launches in the next couple weeks.  Your images might make the gallery.</p>
<p><strong>New website was launched, but now I need to go back through and update the portfolio.  I really dropped the ball on blogging this year so I hope to get some of those beautiful images I captured up on the site.  It brings tears to my eyes when I look back at the images of families I captured,  I know these pictures will be with the families long after the people in the images are gone.  It just gives me so much joy to know I was a part of that process.</strong></p>
<p>4. Grow our family.</p>
<p><strong>Yup!  Baby Carenza is due March of 2014,  watch out world.  I&apos;m excited for this challenge.  I know baby C is going to rock our world, but I think Jon and I are as ready as we&apos;ll ever be to share the love we&apos;ve grown with a little person.  My goal is to teach this little person to live fearlessly with a heart full of love.</strong></p>
<p>When I look back at my goals over the years, I&apos;ve kind of been all over the place, but I think I&apos;m finally finding my footing.  Life just feels right.  I continue to learn and grow, but remember that nothing is more important than staying in the moment.  At the end of the day that&apos;s all we have, a collection of moments.</p>
<p>Happy New Year everyone!  May all your dreams come true in the next 12 months.</p>
