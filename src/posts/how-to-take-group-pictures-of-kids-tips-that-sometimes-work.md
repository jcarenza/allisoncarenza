<p style="text-align: center;">There&apos;s really only one thing harder than herding cats...taking pics of 5 kids four years old and younger, and getting them to smile, and getting them to look at the camera, and getting them to sit still.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ok, in truth, there are probably a lot of things harder, like brain surgery, or building a spaceship, Â but for me, this is my challenge. Â I have very little control of these shoots, but the little control I do have I want to share with you. Â  The itty bitty things I&apos;ve learned along the way that make it more likely to get a good shot. Â I promise these methods won&apos;t work every time, in fact they&apos;ll only work some of the time and sometimes none of the time. Â I think I might have gotten wordy, but you get the point. Â It&apos;s hard, real hard. So without further adieu here are my tips for herding cats, I mean um... taking pictures of cute kids.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1907" title="car9" src="/media/car9.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" srcset="/media/car9.jpg 750w, /media/car9-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tip #1 &#8211; I usually don&apos;t jump right in and start taking pics the second the families arrive, I like to build a little repore with the kids by talking to them. Â I try to make eye contact with them and not their parents. Â While chatting it up about Santa, candy, and favorite sports I try to assess the kids and their attitudes towards pictures, and more importantly me.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1903" title="car5" src="/media/car5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tip #2- I always start with the hardest picture, in this case it was the group picture. Â I usually have very limited time with the limited attention span at this age, so I have to be sure to use my time wisely. Â Get the hard one over with. Â It&apos;s much easier to get one kid focused than 5.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tip #3- It took me a long time to figure out that it&apos;s really best to only have one parent in the room. Â For this family shoot, there were two families, so Â 4 adults, 2 grandparents, 5 kids, and Jon and I crowded into my small studio. Â With all those people the kids get overwhelmed, it gets loud, and the kids don&apos;t Â know where to look because everyone is trying to get them to smile. Â I just ask the parents to pick one person that they think would do the best at nurturing the scared ones, while making the serious ones laugh. Â Between the 3 of us we can usually cover it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1904" title="car6" src="/media/car6.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499" srcset="/media/car6.jpg 700w, /media/car6-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tip #4- Â Kinda goes with tip 3. Â I try to make sure the people that are in the room with me understand that I want the kids to look at the camera, so toward me. Â Parents are awesome at getting their kids to smile, so I usually just ask them to get real close to me. Â Or even play peek a boo behind my head. Â Jon and I do all kinds of crazy things to get kids to look. Layla has sat on my head many a time!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Tip #5- I never put my camera down unless I think I&apos;ve got the shot. Â I&apos;m always always waiting for that perfect expression of the kids personality.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1906" title="car8" src="/media/car8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499" srcset="/media/car8.jpg 700w, /media/car8-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tip #6- I don&apos;t wait for the smiles. Â Sometimes the in between moments are even more precious. Â Like the pic below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1900" title="car2" src="/media/car2.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="499" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tip #7- If kids do get upset and cry I don&apos;t fret, I just work with their sibling, or parents. Â They usually Â come around, because everyone wants to be the center of attention. ðŸ™‚ Â Even kids!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I love that my job is unpredictable, I love that my tricks don&apos;t always work. Â It keeps me on my toes. Â I guess that&apos;s what this post is really about. Stay on your toes, stay ready, and have fun! Â Happy shooting!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By the way I picked THE CUTEST KIDS EVER for this post. Â The Carlisle kids! Â Thanks guys for being so much fun, and sharing so much of yourselves with me!</p>
