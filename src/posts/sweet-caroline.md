<p style="text-align: center;">Sweeeeeet Caroline   bump bump bump.  Good times never seem so good.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I love that song, and I love this sweet Caroline.  She is always a blast to photograph, and today was no different.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Right now she&apos;s sitting up tall and strong, she loves her feet and really loves to suck her big toe, she&apos;s also very happy, and so laid back.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">She also doesn&apos;t stay on one side long, she&apos;s constantly rolling this way and that way.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This big smile on the left is so Caroline.  All.The.Time.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Oh Caroline, all that crazy hair, and your crazy cute face.  It&apos;s too much!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4792" alt="sweet4" src="/media/sweet4.jpg" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I need to give Caroline&apos;s momma Courtney some love.   Because I adore her and because  she just started a little headband business, inspired by her adorable daughter.  You see a lot of her headbands in my pictures and I love them sooooo much!  I&apos;m so happy for her for taking on this new adventure!  You can get your own Cutiebands on facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/CutieBrands">here</a> or Etsy here <a href="http://etsy.com/shop/CutieBrands" target="_blank">etsy.com/shop/CutieBrands</a></p>
