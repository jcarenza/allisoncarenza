I think I come off confident, fearless, and maybe even arrogant.  But&#8230;I&#8217;m really not.  I mean I use to say  that I was fearless.  And I am, when it comes to public speaking, rock climbing, snakes, meeting new people, and trying new things.  But I&#8217;m not when it comes to my photography.   There are so many more talented photogs out there, for me to compare myself to, that often I feel lost, like a single stalk of wheat in a huge field, just trying to be big enough to see what&#8217;s goin&#8217; on.  So today, when I received my <a href="http://www.interiordesign.net/">Interior Design</a> magazine with one of my picture as a full page ad I felt, well, the same.  It&#8217;s funny, I thought some of those insecurities would dissolve.  But I&#8217;m still just Allison, a Kansas City girl, who loves to play tennis, and gets to do what she loves everyday as her job!  I&#8217;m still looking forward, and hoping that someone out there likes my work.  This week I hope to release my new commercial website and I&#8217;m eager but anxious.  Here&#8217;s the ad.  So excited to share!!!!</p>
