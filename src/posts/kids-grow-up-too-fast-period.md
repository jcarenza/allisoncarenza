<p style="text-align: center;">It&apos;s hard to believe 4 years ago I took pictures of little Izzie just days after she was born.  It&apos;s scary really.  Since then I&apos;ve done countless shoots of these two and trust me it never gets old.  Their mom Kim is a wonderful client that has become a good friend.  It&apos;s nice to have the same clients come back year after year.  I get to develop a real relationship with the kids and the parents.  And I love watching them grow and change.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Owen is always ready to have his pictures taken.  He looks right into the camera and pretty much does whatever I ask.  He&apos;s a serious little boy so when I get him to share his sweet little smile (like the 2nd pic) my day is complete.  Izzie on the other hand has always been camera shy.  But now she&apos;s 4, and things have changed.  She was hammin it up!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2834" title="sals3" src="/media/sals33.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;m pretty sure Owen has a modeling career in his near future!  Seriously!!!!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">See look, he&apos;s working on his abs shot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2839" title="sals8" src="/media/sals83.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="500"   />As these two get older I get a little sad.  The good news is that Kim is pregnant with #3 so I get to start all over with a brand new little Salsman!  So excited!!!!!</p>
