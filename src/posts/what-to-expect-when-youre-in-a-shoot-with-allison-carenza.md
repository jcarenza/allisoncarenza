<p style="text-align: center;">These are the Horwitz babies, and they are growing up WAY too fast! Â Thank goodness baby number 3 is on the way, because I love taking their pictures. Â I think the photos below will tell it all, but you need to know little Greyson was so perfect during our shoot he did everything I asked. Â And Lyla, well she&apos;s just happy, and that makes her perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I could go on and on about this awesome family and how much I adore them, but I really want to talk about what to expect on a shoot with me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I guess you could say I&apos;m pretty laid back. Â My first priority is to make sure everyone is relaxed and enjoying the shoot. Â Even if that means taking a little extra time to play with the kids. Â I made a little list of things I do during a shoot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#1 I like to have the people, big and small, looking at me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">To accomplish the whole look at the camera thing I like to jump out from behind the camera, and roar. Â A lot! Â I&apos;m not proud, but it&apos;s me, and it makes the parents laugh. Â No really I&apos;m looking at the kids, but the parents are laughing, because I lookÂ ridiculous. Â I&apos;m fine with it. Â Adults areÂ notoriousÂ for the cheese smile, and it can really mess my photos up. Â ðŸ™‚ Â If I&apos;m taking pictures of the kids alone it can be tricky because the parents know they can get the best smiles out of the kids. Â So I have them stand directly behind me. Â It can get really overwhelming really fast when 2 parents are continually saying a kids name. Â So I try not to say the kids names at all, I just make weird noises and stuff.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Most the time the roar works, except when it makes the kids scared. Â Then I have to sing songs, smile a big as possible, let them play with my camera, make silly faces, and even get Jon to act like a goof behind me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Â #2 Â I am fast</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jon thinks I have super powers. Â Like super hearing, super smelling, and yes super moving. Â I&apos;m going to blame/give credit to my ADD for the super powers. Â My shoots go fast! Â Unless it&apos;s a newborn, then they go really slow. Â I&apos;m going to be moving your kids here, there, and everywhere. Â You won&apos;t even know what happened, but I know when I got the shot, and I move on. Â Fast!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#3 I talk a lot</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I tell stories, ask questions, and want to get to know you and your family. Â My clients become friends so why not start during the shoot. Â ðŸ™‚</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3444" title="hor5" src="/media/hor51.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/hor51.jpg 930w, /media/hor51-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/hor51-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#4 I like to catch your kids being your kids. Â So not smiling in all the pictures is totally fine, because really your kids aren&apos;t smiling all the time in real life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3445" title="hor6" src="/media/hor61.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/hor61.jpg 930w, /media/hor61-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/hor61-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#5 I live for these moments. Â Play with your kids hug them, kiss them, talk to them, and interact with them. Â Just like you would at home, I&apos;m there with my camera ready to capture the most precious moments.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3443" title="hor4" src="/media/hor41.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/hor41.jpg 930w, /media/hor41-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/hor41-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#6 I don&apos;t pose your kids much, I want to see what they&apos;ll do on their own. Â In this picture, I told Greyson to lean against the wall, and bame he gave me this cool guy pose! Â Priceless!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3442" title="hor3" src="/media/hor31.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/hor31.jpg 930w, /media/hor31-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/hor31-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#7 I like to set your kids up. Â I put Lyla in this box and she loved it! Â She was having a blast. Â Sometimes it&apos;s the most simple thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3441" title="hor2" src="/media/hor21.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/hor21.jpg 930w, /media/hor21-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/hor21-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3440" title="hor1" src="/media/hor11.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/hor11.jpg 930w, /media/hor11-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/hor11-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#8 And sometimes I&apos;ll make you do something you don&apos;t want to do. Â For example, I saw this amazing light and couldn&apos;t let it get wasted on Jon, so as we&apos;re loading up our cars I asked Colleen to step into this light and we were able to get this beautiful portrait! Â I told Colleen it would make a beautiful facebook picture and she laughed out loud. Â She&apos;s the most humble person ever and I&apos;m pretty sure she&apos;s mortified that I even posted it. Â (reread first sentence of #8)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So that&apos;s it! Â 8 things to expect on your shoot with me. Â I&apos;m sure there&apos;s more, but you&apos;ll just have to come see me!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Toodles!</p>
