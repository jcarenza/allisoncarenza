<p style="text-align: center;">So this post was inspired by one of my most favorite clients, little Eva from Arkansas.  Here is the facebook message I received today titled &#8220;You have competition&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Allison &#8211; Eva got a &#8220;pink camera&#8221; for Christmas (Santa came early to our house as we are leaving for Boston tmw). She has been quite a shutterbug ever since &#8211; truly hilarious. By about 9 am, she had taken 200 photos. Of which, 20 were good. My favorites were the pictures of the TV while she was watching her new Tinkerbell movie. We&apos;ve also enjoyed holding one of her toys while she takes a picture of it. This may be her calling.... :)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">So having shared this I was inspired to post a list of the gifts that left their mark on me.  I&apos;ll try to keep this short because I know all of you have your own presents to unwrap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">My top 10 favorite Christmas presents of all time...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">10. A sewing machine  &#8211; My brother James gave me a pretty hard time about this one. He thought I was nerdy, I thought I was finally free.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">9.  A wicker vanity- Ok, this one wasn&apos;t that great when I finally realized it was furniture, but the under tree suspense was huge, because the boxes were out of this world big and wrapped.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">8.  A leather jacket- My mom totally had me crying at that Christmas because I thought I hadn&apos;t gotten it only to watch her pull it out...after Christmas.  I was pretty snotty at that gangly age of 13 and probably deserved it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">7. Plastic white bouncey horse- I don&apos;t remember this one much but the home videos are evidence enough that I really really loved it!  Even bonked my mouth on the hard plastic mane and kept on riding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">6.  A funeral package &#8211; I&apos;m not lying, my dad bought Jon and I plots and funeral packages.  Apparently it&apos;s a big investment.  I told him it was the gift of eternity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5.  Stuffed reindeer &#8211; Every year my mom would put a reindeer in my stocking.  I was a stuffed animal buff  and loved it when I would see that little fuzzy head sticking out of my stocking.  I&apos;m still hoping she brings that tradition back someday.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4.  G.I. Joes, homemade guns, and barbies, I couldn&apos;t pick.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. A mixed music casette tape my brother made for me by copying off his own collection. I don&apos;t remember all the songs, but I do remember &#8220;Desperado&#8221; and &#8220;Allison&apos;s Road&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. My engagement ring &#8211; Jon had it all wrapped up in a nice story of our relationship.  Pure perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. Money &#8211; Sorry for the serious anticlimatic nature of this one, but need I say more?  Really?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">This wasn&apos;t an easy task because really I&apos;ve been blessed with so many gifts over the years, it&apos;s hard to pick favorites, but these were the first to come to mind.  Nowadays, Jon and I don&apos;t even exchange gifts.  We buy trips around the world,  furniture, and tennis lessons, to share together.  When I look back my favorite gifts have nothing to do with the actual gift, the unwrapping, or the suspence of opening them, rather, I remember the moments in time that these material objects help me remember.  Isn&apos;t that what it&apos;s really about, a moment in time marked with a feeling of joy and complete happiness.  I wish all of you joy and complete happiness this holiday season.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I have so much love in my heart for all of you!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Happy Holidays!!!!!</p>
