<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Harry! Â Harry Winston! Â He&apos;s a Chinese Crested champion show dog! Â Retired already at the age of 2. Â He now spends his days cuddled up with his mom Samantha, mostly being spoiled.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am a dog lover, so when Samantha contacted me to take pictures of her kid, Harry, I jumped at the chance. Â Harry started the shoot just like the above picture, Â a little skeptical, a little unsure, a little nervous, but it didn&apos;t take long for him to warm up, and start flashing us those champion dog good looks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I think he looks a little like a Fragglerock. Â Loved that show!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Apparently this is how Harry sleeps, on his back. Â Seriously, this picture cracks me up, how adorable!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Harry might be adorable, but Samantha is gorgeous inside and out! Â I just love when a new client comes in and I immediately bond with them. Â The more we talked the more we realized we like all the same things. Â One of the best perks of my job is all the cool people I meet and become friends with. Â I just know this is the case with Sam.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This is one of my favorites! Â Dramatic!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Fragglerock maybe, later I realized he&apos;s really a mini horse. Â I was surprised to find out Sam doesn&apos;t trim him. Â His hair naturally grows this way. Â Like a horse, he&apos;s got a mane, a tail, and fluff around his feet. Â The hair on his back would be comparable to a mans beard, but it&apos;s really soft. Â The best part is that Chinese Crested puppies are hypo allergenic. Â For more information read<a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/chinese_crested/"> here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I asked Samantha what voice she would give Harry if he could talk. Â She thought surfer originally, but he&apos;s too classy for that. Â We both agreed George Clooney. Â He&apos;s sophisticated, grey, and too cool for words. Â He also totally snubbed my girls when we let them out to visit.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1493" title="har2" src="/media/har2.jpg" alt="" width="673" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Did I mention he also runs like a horse.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1498" title="har7" src="/media/har7.jpg" alt="" width="770" height="535"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;m not sure Harry isn&apos;t Â human in this picture. Â I mean it&apos;s so obvious he loves Samantha as much as she loves him!</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1492" title="har1" src="/media/har1.jpg" alt="" width="721" height="500"   /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1495" title="har4" src="/media/har4.jpg" alt="" width="673" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">His hair really does look this good. Â I wish my hair had that much volume.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1503" title="har12" src="/media/har12.jpg" alt="" width="721" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Samantha and Harry, I loved our time together, in fact I was sad when you left. Â Feel free to come by anytime!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Allison! HOLY COW.<br />
You are an absolute GENIUS!! I literally cried today when I saw that one with Harry&apos;s eyes closed when I was kissing him! LOVE IT!! Love it, Love it!! I could not have been happier with the 10 that you put on facebook AND THEN when I saw the whole lot of them... breathtaking! I LOVE THEM ALL!!!<br />
I really cant thank you enough. You captured exactly what I was looking for plus some! And that is an amazing feat as I really had no idea what I was looking for! ðŸ™‚</p>
