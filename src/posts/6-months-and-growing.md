<p style="text-align: center;">It&apos;s alarming just how fast 6 months go by!  It seems like just yesterday I was taking Krystal and Nic&apos;s maternity pics, now Hudson is almost crawling.  I love watching my clients grow up, but it reminds me of just how fast quickly life passes us by, and just how important it is to live in every moment.  Which is just what we did at the Boggs&apos;s shoot.  We laughed, cracked up really at all of Hudson&apos;s cute antics.  I love my job.  Taking pictures is my passion, but working with my clients makes my life awesome!</p>
