<p style="text-align: center;">Some families are just cute!  There&apos;s just no other way to describe it, and that&apos;s just how I feel about the Guffey&apos;s!  Meet Bobby, Gage, Trisha, and Gracelyn.  This shoot was a special one.  Not only is little Gracelyn 6 months old, but Gage is getting ready to undergo a massive skull surgery, that will require him to shave his head and spend weeks in painful recovery.  What a brave little boy, and strong set of parents.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our shoot was full of laughter, just as it should be.  I hope you love the pics as much as I loved taking them.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Gracelyn your chub is just right!  I love you to pieces!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Gage is an awesome big brother and it&apos;s obvious they adore each other!  Gracelyn is lucky to have such a strong, protective brother.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I am happy to announce Gage is out of surgery and back to school.  The poor little guy had to fight for a few weeks, but he&apos;s back at it ready to take on life!  I&apos;m so proud of you Gage.  You are a role model to all of us!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
