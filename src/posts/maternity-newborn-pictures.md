<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">I love taking maternity pictures!  I mean I really really love taking maternity pictures.  Pregnant women are beautiful and it&apos;s not really about the bump, but what&apos;s going on inside.  I mean they are making another little person and it&apos;s amazing!  Not only that, but all pregnant women glow.  And I love capturing those moments.  I also love that I still do my maternity pictures in my house.  My new studio is awesome, but I feel like I get closer to my clients when they come to my house.  This below picture is taken in my bedroom.  People walk into my house as strangers and out as friends.  I love it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Kelli.  She&apos;s one of the lucky ones that somehow maintained her figure while she was pregnant.  I do help the new mommas out with a little photoshop here and little there, but not necessary here.  Kelli you rock!  We laughed, told stories, and I tripped over cords because I was so distracted by this fun couple.  That&apos;s a lie, I always trip over my equipment.  But this shoot was so much fun!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Hubby Adam was so much fun to work with.  It&apos;s always the best when the dad&apos;s are just as much fun to photograph!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4058" title="kelli2" src="/media/kelli2.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Beautiful light!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4059" title="kelli3" src="/media/kelli3.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4060" title="kelli4" src="/media/kelli4.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;m kinda getting into out of focus pictures on purpose.  It&apos;s a phase I&apos;m sure, but I&apos;m diggin it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4061" title="kelli5" src="/media/kelli5.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then baby Corbin arrived.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4062" title="knight1" src="/media/knight1.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And slept like a dream!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4063" title="knight2" src="/media/knight2.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Kelli smiled the whole time!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4064" title="knight3" src="/media/knight3.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And Adam was a natural.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4065" title="knight4" src="/media/knight4.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">First family portraits are one of my favorites to capture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4066" title="knight5" src="/media/knight5.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">I know I started by saying I love maternity pictures, but I also love those sweet moments during newborn sessions when the parents are all lost in their baby.  I love my job!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thanks Kelli, Corbin, and Adam  for making my dream a reality!</p>
