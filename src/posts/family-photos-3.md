<p style="text-align: center;">Summer is finally here, and with it comes beautiful light, long days, and hot hot sun!  I meet the Vinson&apos;s at Unity Village in the late afternoon for their shoot.  It was hot, but everyone was in an awesome mood.  Ayden was all over the place just like a 2 year old should be, Jenn and Joey were also all over the place chasing Ayden, and Brady was happy just sitting and watching it all go down.  I love this family!  It seems like just yesterday I was taking Jenn and Joey&apos;s maternity pics, time is flying!</p>
