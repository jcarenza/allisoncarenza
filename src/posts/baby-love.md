<p style="text-align: center;">All new moms are in love with their babies.  But some have this all over glow about motherhood and that&apos;s just how I would describe Jennifer.  She is obsessed, in love, totally addicted to her little girl Macy.  Even being pooped on, peed on and spit up on can&apos;t discourage her from her job of being the best mom ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Meet little Macy, she is one lucky little lady!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Macy did a fabulous job on the shoot.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Daddy Dave was just as adoring.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Baby Macy, you totally made my day.  I loved getting to take your pics.  Grow up to be big and strong just like your parents.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
