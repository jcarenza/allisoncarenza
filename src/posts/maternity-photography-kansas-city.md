<p style="text-align: center;">I have been taking so many pictures of bellies lately!  I absolutely love it.  Pregnant women are stunning and Deanna is no different.  Here is the story of our wonderful time together.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-637" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/archives/636/deanna1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-637" title="deanna1" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/deanna1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="/media/deanna1.jpg 600w, /media/deanna1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Deanna tried for years to get preganant with her now ex husband before they finally gave up.  With severe Endometriosis and cancer in her past the doctors told her she was unable to conceive.    So she stopped trying, and stopped worrying about it all together.  She has a huge family with tons of nephews  and nieces that she was very close to.  She had accepted the role as an aunt as her reality, and the closest she was ever going to get to being a mommy.  After her divorce she started living her life again.  No worries of babies or trying to make babies.  She started dating a long time friend, and you can see where this is going.  That&apos;s when she got the news!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-639" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/archives/636/deanna4"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-639" title="Deanna4" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Deanna4.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" srcset="/media/Deanna4.jpg 400w, /media/Deanna4-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She was surprised to say the least and her mom was so surprised that she didn&apos;t even believe her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Deanna you are going to make an awesome mommy! Thanks for letting me take your maternity pictures, I had a blast!  I can&apos;t wait to meet the little man.</p>
