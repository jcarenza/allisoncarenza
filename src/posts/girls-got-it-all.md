<p>She the triple threat, so smart, so beautiful, and such a big personality!  Meet Laura, a Blue Springs senior ready to take on the world.  And I have no doubt she will.  She ambitious, smart, beautiful, and she&apos;s got a gigantic personality, which is my favorite trait.  With dreams of becoming a surgeon and a future at Mizzou, this girl is going to change the world.  Our shoot was full of laughter, funny faces, and lots of beautiful images.  I had 15 more picked out to share, but no time, here are just a few of my favs.  Laura you were a blast!  Here&apos;s a blog post for you girlfriend!<br />

<p>Such classic beauty.  I should mention that Laura looked so good she got hit on during this shoot by an interesting downtown dweller.  She handled it like a champ.  I&apos;m pretty sure if it would have gotten bad she would have just taken off her 4 inch heel and gone to battle.</p>

<p>These pictures showcase the beautiful fierce side of Laura, but really she&apos;s goofy through and through.  I adore her!</p>
