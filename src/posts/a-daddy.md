<p style="text-align: center;">When Ken told me he wanted pictures with his baby girl in his firefighter uniform, I did that thing where I gulp down my fear and smile. Â And I&apos;m so glad I did because this is the image we were able to capture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Little Gracie is so lucky. Â I have no doubt her daddy is going to do everything he can to keep her safe. Â Even if that includes putting bars on the windows when she&apos;s a teenager. Â ðŸ™‚</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Gracie came to me sleepy and oh so ready for pictures. Â All my fiddling couldn&apos;t wake her. Â She was in the mood for sleep and sleep she did. Â It was so much fun for me.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Ken and Amy are such a perfect pair, I have no doubt they will be make the perfect parents too.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">People often tell me I have the best job, and I have to agree!</p>
