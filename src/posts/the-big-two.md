<p style="text-align: center;">I joke that photographing 2 year olds is much like herding cats, but I&apos;m not really joking.  Most of my parents come into the studio nervous for their 2 year old shoot because they know their two year old doesn&apos;t exactly follow directions...ever.  And its totally ok.  I let the kids run and move and jump on things, and I capture the faces and expression in between those fun things.  Yes, photographing a 2 year old is a challenge, but it&apos;s also a great age because the emotions I capture are so very real.  They haven&apos;t learned the camera face yet, and their not afraid to show you their ugliest faces, which sometimes turn out to be the best expressions.  Sometimes I have to ask myself what do my clients want and need in these images to help them remember their two year old, just as they are.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is little Eleanor and she is 2 and so full of life.  I had the honor of documenting these precious moments in her life.  I hope you enjoy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I get pretty attached to my families and the Aversman family is one of those families.  Unfortunately new opportunities are taking them away from KC. 🙁  But hopefully not before I get to photograph baby #2.  Another surprise!  I can&apos;t wait!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;ll miss you guys.  Maybe I can take your pics when you visit!</p>
