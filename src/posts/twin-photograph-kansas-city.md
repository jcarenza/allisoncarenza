<p style="text-align: center;">The following pictures make me feel like a great photog.  That doesn&apos;t always happen, and it feels incredible!  I can&apos;t take credit though, it wasn&apos;t my expensive camera or lens, it wasn&apos;t the rustic awesome setting, it was the girls.  Twin girls!  They  made this shoot flawless.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The pic below is right out of a fairytale.  I&apos;m picturing a new version of Little Red Riding Hood.  I guess it would be Little Red Riding Hoods.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1706" title="scr2" src="/media/scr2.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" srcset="/media/scr2.jpg 750w, /media/scr2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Jenna and Janae.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712" title="scr8" src="/media/scr8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499" srcset="/media/scr8.jpg 700w, /media/scr8-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">They started the shoot shy and reserved, but that didn&apos;t last long.  Soon they realized having their picture taken was all about having fun.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1708" title="scr4" src="/media/scr4.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" srcset="/media/scr4.jpg 750w, /media/scr4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1711" title="scr7" src="/media/scr7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499" srcset="/media/scr7.jpg 700w, /media/scr7-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">They are identical twins, but there are slight differences, both physical and in their presonalities.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1707" title="scr3" src="/media/scr3.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="499" srcset="/media/scr3.jpg 751w, /media/scr3-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jenna is a little more brave, a little more outgoing, and a little more bold.  Janae is more independent, and slow to trust, but once she does, she&apos;s all love.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1713" title="scr9" src="/media/scr9.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499" srcset="/media/scr9.jpg 700w, /media/scr9-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Both are alike in so many ways, but different too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1710" title="scr6" src="/media/scr6.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" srcset="/media/scr6.jpg 750w, /media/scr6-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Twins have an undeniable connection that keeps them close forever.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1714" title="scr10" src="/media/scr10.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499" srcset="/media/scr10.jpg 700w, /media/scr10-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Their parents Joy and Tom have done a wonderful job of fostering their twin connection, but also showing them they are independent people.  What a fine balance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I met Joy my second year as a teacher.  I guess you could say she was a mentor, but that would be an understatement.  She was so much more.  She&apos;s an amazing teacher to this day, but  I remember when she and Tom were struggling trying to get pregnant.  Like me she put off having kids, so it took a long time.  Just as she was about to give up she got the news.  I&apos;ll never forget the joy she had when she found out she was pregnant, and with twins!  She was so happy!  I&apos;m so happy for her.  It&apos;s so clear Joy&apos;s and Tom&apos;s life wouldn&apos;t be complete without these girls.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1709" title="scr5" src="/media/scr5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" srcset="/media/scr5.jpg 750w, /media/scr5-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">THIS is my favorite.  I mean at the end of the day what&apos;s important?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1705" title="scr1" src="/media/scr1.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="499" srcset="/media/scr1.jpg 751w, /media/scr1-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Joy, Tom, Jenna, Janae, thank you soooo much for letting me take your pics.  Words can&apos;t describe.</p>
