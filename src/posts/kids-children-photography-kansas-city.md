<p style="text-align: center;">This is Elijah and he is adorable.  I&apos;ve been taking his pictures since he was itty bitty.  So when his family moved to Chicago I was so sad.  But then Katy his momma called me and told me they were coming into town for his first birthday.  Perfect for pictures.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This picture cracks me up.  He looks like he&apos;s in timeout.  What you don&apos;t see it the 3 silly adults behind the camera juming around trying to get his attention.  I swear kids can be so smart.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">But eventually we won, and Elijah gave in.  Check out those awesome eyes and little tiny teeth.  Fabulous!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Aaron, Katy, and Elijah thanks for coming and seeing me during your valuable family time.  I just love taking your pictures!</p>
