<p style="text-align: center;">My portrait business is a big part of my livelihood, because I love the people I get to meet and often they become friends.  It&#8217;s awesome, and right now there isn&#8217;t anything else in the world I&#8217;d rather be doing.  But I know my job is going to have to evolove.  I&#8217;m a creature of change, and I want to grow as a professional photographer.  So I&#8217;ve been dabbling in all sorts of photography genre&#8217;s.  One of which is art shows.  I remember when I would walk the streets of the Plaza Art Fair and think someday I want to be here, doing this.  But it was one of those dreams you quickly tuck away and disregard.  Because the people in those art shows, they are brave, and I am not.  But slowly I&#8217;ve taken steps to make that dream a reality.  A couple weekends ago I had my Indonesia work on display in my tent at the Zona Rosa Art Festival.  I was finally one of those brave artists.  And it was awesome!  People came, they looked, they OOOhhhed, and Ahhhed.  They talked to me about my work, but I didn&#8217;t sell any of my big pieces.  🙁  I was really sad and frustrated.  I started to wonder if it was my work, if it was me, I started to feel the brave artist melting away with my drive to follow my dreams.  I questioned what&#8217;s important, to be an artist that has something to share, or to be an artist that has something to sell.  I still don&#8217;t have the answers, but I do know I need my work to represent the person I am, the life I&#8217;ve lived, and the experiences I&#8217;ve had.  Staying true to my passion is what I&#8217;ll do for now.  I&#8217;ll pick my head up, and look ahead because I might not be brave, but I&#8217;m tough.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here are my 3 big ones.  These are all 36&#215;46.  Buddha sit by my at work.</p>
