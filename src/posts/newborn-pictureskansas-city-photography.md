<p style="text-align: center;">Remember beautiful Mecia with the prefect belly.  Well this is her baby Jonah.  He is big and beautiful.  We had a great time taking his pictures even though he wanted to eat the ENTIRE time.  That&apos;s what makes newborns a challenge.  Being that these little guys have only been on Earth a few days  or weeks it&apos;s hard to predict their mood.  Jonah&apos;s mood was easy... hungry.  Despite the hunger we managed to get him to go to sleep for a bit and caputre some perfect pictures.  Here are just a few.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Jonah&apos;s daddy Ashely is a war hero. He was a marine and was in Iraq when we declared war.  He was literally the first on duty.  Ashley is still recovering physically and emotionally but you can&apos;t tell.  He is a super loving father who has embraced fatherhood with an open heart and tolerance.  Every new parent needs that.  When I met Ashley during maternity pics I had no idea he was a hero.  Now that I know I&apos;m a little star struck.  Seeing celebrities doesn&apos;t do much for me, but meeting someone like Ashely that fights for our country, puts his life on the line for us, now thats cool!  Thank you Ashley.  I hope you know you are appreciated, and even better, Jonah is going to grow up to be so proud!</p>
