<p style="text-align: center;">With the holidays barely behind us it&apos;s time to start thinking about the next holiday. Â One of my favs...Valentine&apos;s Day! Â I love the candy, flowers, dinner dates, pink and red galore, the basic concept, and of course the cards. Â I don&apos;t even care that it&apos;s a very successful Hallmark marketing scheme. Â What I don&apos;t love is coming up with a good gift for Jon. Â That&apos;s mostly why I love taking BOUDOIR photos and making the daunting task of shopping for hubby easy. Â Super easy. Â Here are a few of the pics I recently took. Â I wish I could share more, but privacy is important. Â She was super ecstatic to share the pics, because she loved how she looked. Â You should know she&apos;s around 40. Â I&apos;ll just leave it at that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">There is just a few thing you should know about my boudoir photography.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. All the pics are tastefully done, I like to consider them art. Â Really hot art.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. The shoots last about an hour and a half.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. I&apos;ll help you with wardrobe.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4. It really helps if you get your makeup professionally done.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">5. You can drink wine and bring a friend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">6. I promise to make you look and feel your very best, inside and out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">7. Yes, I will airbrush you to perfection. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">8. Ultimately you control the shoot, but I will guide you through poses and coach you on how to look sexy. Â Don&apos;t worry smiles are also so sexy, if you&apos;re like me and look ridiculous being serious.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">9. Lastly, I love doing these boudoir pictures. Â They are some of my favorite shoots to take.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Here are some of the comments a few of my lovely ladies have given me about their experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;My boudoir session was AMAZING!Â  I was so apprehensive about doing it because, I am not a fan of my body, but I wanted to do it for my husband to have on our wedding day.Â  When I left your studio, I was so confident with myself and the curves I have.Â  You made the session so comfortable and truly made me feel beautiful with all of my curves!!Â  When I saw the pictures, it made me look at myself in a new way.Â  Not only did I like my body but you captured parts of my that I would have never seen as beautiful.Â  I was amazed!!!Â  These pictures did so much for my self image!Â  Oh yeah, and my husband loves them too!!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Allison is a wonderful photographer. After having some fantastic pictures taken of our 2 month old I decided a boudoir shoot would be a great Christmas present for my husband. Being a little hesitant, as I had only given birth 13 weeks ago and wasn&apos;t quite back to pre-baby body, I called her up and scheduled a shoot. It was so much fun! You lose all sense of being self-conscious. She makes you feel like a supermodel! I highly recommend to all women, not only as a great gift for your significant other, but also as an intense self-esteem booster.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I decided my boyfriend of two years needed a little motivation to take the next step. I asked Allison to take some sexy pics of me in my &#8216;hint hint&apos; panties and she helped make my dream come true. My pictures were not only beautiful but a work of art, I&apos;ve never looked or felt more beautiful. My boyfriend must of felt the same because he took the &#8216;hint&apos; and we&apos;re currently engaged.&#8221;</p>
