<p>I always thought having a baby of my own would change me as a photographer, but much like becoming a parent, words can&apos;t describe it.  I notice everything, all the little parts and expressions that I might have overlooked before, but now I know just how precious, how cherished, and how important it is for me to capture ALL OF IT!</p>
<p>Jaclyn came to me for boudoir photos awhile back, and we became fast friends.  I guess the boudoir photos worked because she was happily pregnant the next time I saw her. We were able to capture Jaclyn&apos;s maternity pics just in time.  Little Abbi made an early arrival, just three days after my own Kellen.  But lucky for me Jaclyn waited for me to be ready to do her newborn pictures.  Today was the day, and I loved every second of our time together.</p>

<p>Sweet Abbi has sooo much hair!  I just loved it.  I was OUT OF CONTROL!</p>

<p>Daddy Eric couldn&apos;t make the shoot so he insisted the girls use the hat during the shoot.  So happy she let us get this picture.  I know he will really love this in 10 years!</p>

<p>Abbi and Jaclyn I loved sharing this afternoon with you!  I couldn&apos;t have asked for a more perfect client to come back to after maternity leave.</p>
<p>xoxo</p>
