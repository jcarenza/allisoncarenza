<p style="text-align: center;">Nikki had a beautiful wedding, a perfect day really, except the pictures.  They were no good, and did a horrible job of representing their most perfect day.  So when I offered a contest for a trash the dress shoot on my facebook page, Nikki was desperate to win, and get a photo redo.   She begged, nagged, and pleaded with her friends to vote for her, and it worked because she won.  We had to wait months for the weather to warm up for the shoot.  But it&#8217;s a good thing we did because we had the chance to get in the lake.  And it was ohhh so cool!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I had a blast being Nikki&#8217;s redo photographer.  I would love to do more trash the dress shoots.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Nikki you are fierce!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4221" title="trash5" src="/media/trash5.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/trash5.jpg 930w, /media/trash5-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/trash5-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We shot at <a href="http://www.jacksongov.org/content/7880/7886/7968/default.aspx">Longview lake</a> at dusk.  I had my profoto battery pack and beauty dish to even out the patchy unreliable light.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I was really excited with how natural the light looks.</p>
