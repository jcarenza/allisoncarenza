<p style="text-align: center;">Ok, honestly I&#8217;ve started this post several times only to delete it, and start again. Â I just don&#8217;t want to come offÂ unappreciative, or, I don&#8217;t know, bitchy.Â  Â I&#8217;ll try one more time, and if I don&#8217;t get it right I&#8217;m just going to post the pics and let you enjoy this beautiful boy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I post pictures of sleeping babies, or babies really content, but I don&#8217;t post pictures of the in between times, when the baby is awake, uncomfortable from gas, or just wiggly. Â Those times happen more than the sleepy times. Â I always strive to get the baby sleepy, but it doesn&#8217;t always happen. Â And sometimes the parents come in expecting their baby just to sleep the shoot away, but it isn&#8217;t always the case. Â And they feel bad, and I try to make them realize it&#8217;s normal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Take this little guy. Â ðŸ™‚ Like a lot of newborns he is a gassy little guy, that&#8217;s also a light sleeper. Â So I would get A shot and then have to take a break for 15 minutes to get him relaxed again, or to help him work out the gas. Â I love those minutes in between. Â I get my baby fill, I also get the chance to bond with the parents.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For the shot below I spent about 10 minutes adjusting the blanket, moving his fingers, and positioning his face, so it was just right. Â Getting the perfect shot just takes time. Â And I love it!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This little guy happened to be a big time smiler!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">I love a sleepy baby, but I don&#8217;t mind a fussy baby, or an awake baby. Â I just love working with the babies. Â And each and every one is so different, and so perfect!</p>
