<p style="text-align: center;">When I arrived in little historic Lexington Missouri I couldn&apos;t help but notice the quaintness of the city.  Every turn I made opened a new set of photo opportunities. The ancient houses, the quiet streets, and historic nature gave me a hunger for photography like I was 8 again.  It was picture perfect just like the day.  I was the lucky photographer that got to watch this day unfold as Christi and Brian made their vows to one another for...forever.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Christi was over the moon all day.  She was dancing and singing and having an all around great time.  It was a party for real.  And with 7 bridesmaids you can just imagine the laughter while they got ready.  She is so very lucky to have such great friends.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Dancing to her own beat and loving her dress and the way it feels!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">After the ceremony we were able to go the Anderson house, which is a historic pre civil war building.  In fact it was a hospital during the civil war.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Anderson house sits atop a hill and the light was absolutely stunning,  you can&apos;t tell, but it was hot too!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The wedding party was huge, and they knew how to party big too!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Brian had a rowdy bunch of friends, hilarious and just my style!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Christi and Brian have been apart for the past few months finishing up school, so you can imagine trying to plan the wedding, and see each other as much as possible was a challenge.  But, they are finally able to be together full time now.  With Christi getting a job in Springfield just days after the wedding and Brian moving down and finding a job as well, it&apos;s almost like fate had a hand in this love.  I hope you two enjoy every moment together.  They go by so very fast.</p>
