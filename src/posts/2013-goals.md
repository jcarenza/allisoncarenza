<p>The past few weeks have been super relaxing. Â We went to St. Louis to see Jon&apos;s family, we spent time with my family, and I even got to hang out with a bunch of old friends. Â I couldn&apos;t have asked for a better holiday break, but now it&apos;s time to get back to work. Â First things first! Â I&apos;ve got to look at my goals from 2012 and reassess. Â ðŸ™‚</p>
<p><strong>Goals...some are ongoing and some are new.</strong></p>
<p>1.Â Grow my business. Â That means following up with clients, asking them for referrals, and being brave enough to put myself out there.</p>
<p><strong>I guess I&apos;ll never be done working on this goal.Â </strong></p>
<p>2. Â Add a second workshop to the lineup. Â Maybe fore lightroom, or portrait photography. Â Something that goes a little deeper.</p>
<p><strong>I love hosting workshops and I need to get my 2013 workshops planned. Â I wanted to add a second workshop in 2012, but that didn&apos;t happen so I&apos;ll add that to this years goals.</strong></p>
<p>3. I have an invention I&apos;m working on. Â It&apos;s slow going, but one little step at a time. Â I hope to have a working prototype this year.</p>
<p><strong>The prototype is all but done. Â It&apos;s been a year of tests for me, and I&apos;ve learned a ton, but I&apos;m ready to get this thing off the ground.</strong></p>
<p>4. Jon and I are building a shopping cart for photogs. Â It&apos;s in the BETA phase, but we want to share it for free with options to upgrade.</p>
<p>5. Still need to find someone to help out with the workload, but I&apos;m getting so close.</p>
<p><strong>YAY! Â Victoria! Â If you haven&apos;t had a chance to meet Victoria I&apos;ll just say she&apos;s awesome! Â What a great addition to the AC Photo team.</strong></p>
<p>6. Get my new website launched. Â We&apos;ve been working on it for about 6 months and it&apos;s going to be awesome. Â I&apos;ll be sure to let you know when it launches in the next couple weeks. Â Your images might make the gallery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2012 had so much momentum for me, too much in fact, Â I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s over. Â I also made sacrifices this year. Â I sold my horse Diamond so I could focus more on my business. Â It was the hardest thing I&apos;ve ever done, but it was good for both of us. Â I also traveled to many countries, which always gives me new perspective. Â I played in the WTT nationals again. I attended two workshops with awesome photographers, Jeff Lipsky, and Andrew Eccles. Â They changed my photography forever. Â I spent a lot of money on new equipment. Â I took risks, that sometimes failed, but I kept moving forward. Â For 2013 I want to work on staying focused on what&apos;s important, people, relationships, taking time to myself, and helping give people images that they will cherish for a lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Happy New Year everyone! Â May all your dreams come true in the next 12 months.</p>
