<p style="text-align: center;">This story starts like any good newborn story, with a belly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1406" title="hor7" src="/media/hor7.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1408" title="hor9" src="/media/hor9.jpg" alt="" width="713" height="500"   />A perfect belly, beautiful really. Â This belly belongs to Colleen, she&apos;s one of those pretty pregnant people. Â I mean I think all pregnant women are glowing and beautiful, but some just seem to get lucky, and Colleen is one of those women.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1407" title="hor8" src="/media/hor8.jpg" alt="" width="713" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is her baby Greyson, he&apos;s not so much a baby anymore and much more like a boy. Â He didn&apos;t really know what he was getting into when his parents told him he was going to be a big brother in a month. Â I&apos;m sure ideas of a little playmate where first on his mind. Â Even though Lyla may not have met Greyson&apos;s expectations entirely, he loves her all the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By the way Greyson is at that fun age for photogs when they like to make the cheese smile. Â It only lasts about a year, but man it&apos;s hard to get a genuine smile. Â I feel so fortunate to have captured this shot. Â This is Greyson&apos;s REAL smile. Â ðŸ™‚</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I tried several times to type something about this pic, but words can&apos;t describe. Â It&apos;s soooo hard to get a good newborn /sibling pic. Â I usually warn parents about the bad odds, but on this day the odds were in our favor. Â Aww I can see this on their senior slidshow.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1402" title="hor3" src="/media/hor3.jpg" alt="" width="713" height="500"   /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1404" title="hor5" src="/media/hor5.jpg" alt="" width="715" height="500"   /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1403" title="hor4" src="/media/hor4.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Colleen and Greg are such natural parents taking pictures was easy. Â Newborn shoots require patience, endurance, creativity...and milk.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1400" title="hor1" src="/media/hor1.jpg" alt="" width="713" height="500"   /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1401" title="hor2" src="/media/hor2.jpg" alt="" width="713" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Little Lyla you couldn&apos;t have been born into a better family. Â You will have so much love in your life!</p>
