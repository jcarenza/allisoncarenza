<p style="text-align: center;">Aspen Colorado might be one of the most beautiful places on Earth.  Big blue skies, untouched mountains, and perfect snow.  Jon and I were lucky enough to go ski this awesome mountain.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Jon is such a cutie!  He is addicted to skiing even more than me.  Most of these pictures were taken on the same day because we only had one day of solid sunshine.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Aspen  is one of my new favorites for a couple reasons.  First of all it&apos;s not busy at all, secondly it is dark, and I like a good challenge.  Finally I love that the mountain literally runs right into the middle of the town of Aspen.  The Gondala that takes you to the top is right in the middle of everything.  I love that.  I also love that the people were all about making our experience pefect.  They helped us load our skis on the Gondala, gave us hot cider and granola bars, for free, and they always greeted us with a huge smile.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The above pictue was taken at Snowmass the big mountain a short shuttle ride away from Aspen.  That&apos;s another great feature about Aspen, their public transportation is perfect.  We didn&apos;t wait once!  On this particular day the clouds were sitting low on the mountain, so Jon and I stayed on a run called campground.  It was a long black, covered in powder, but not too many bumps so Jon was happy.   No one was around so we had a blast with this run to ourselves.  We started the long run in a cloud, but ended it in the sun.  There are several other shots of campground to come.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-512" title="Aspen6" src="/media/Aspen6.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="600" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">On our last day on the mountain we made a plan to meet at this lift.  Well Jon hit a slick spot and missed the turn and ended up at the bottom.  I didn&apos;t know and ended up at the lift.  No worries until he didn&apos;t show up for 5 minutes.  He&apos;s never 1 minute behind let alone 5.  That&apos;s when the worrying started.  All the worst images started popping up in my head.  I sent our friend Ron to go on up so he could try to find him, hopefully not sprawled out on the ground somewhere.  I&apos;ve been in this position before when my dad got injured and I waited for 15 minutes before my family came and told me what happened.  Luckily we have cell phones now!  When I finally heard his voice after 3 missed calls it was all good.  I was at the lift for about 30 minutes waiting for him to get down and back up and back down to me.  I was the only person at this lift with these 2 hilarious lift managers.  The above picture was the dancer.  He had Lady Gaga blasting and he was dancing up a storm.  Very entertaining!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Jon and I spent most of our trip on Aspen we liked it so much.  We would take the Gondola up and ski all the way down.</p>
