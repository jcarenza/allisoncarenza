<p style="text-align: center;">When Nikki contacted me a few months ago about doing pictures, she was excited, nervous, and a little unsure.  I could hear it in her emails, so  when she told me her son was born with EEC syndrome, and explained that he&#8217;s missing some fingers and toes, and was also born without tear ducts, I understood why.  She also told me he&#8217;s a shy little boy and she wasn&#8217;t real sure how the pictures were going to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Well let me just say I think I&#8217;m in love with Brady.  He smiled, laughed, grinned, and worked the camera like it was his job.  I think or maybe hope he had a little crush on me.  Most of the pictures I  captured that day are of him grinning ear to ear, but I picked this one to share.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You see, Brady might be handicapped physically because he doesn&#8217;t have all his fingers and toes, but his heart is full of enough love to make up for it.  When I took this picture I got chills, but at the time I didn&#8217;t know why.  When I opened it I realized he was looking right through the camera at me.  He didn&#8217;t let the camera act as a barrier like most people.  He connected with me.  Brady has the special ability to really see people.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">His big sister Morgan is the most loving, supportive sister anyone could ask for.   I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s hard for her at times being the sister of a brother with EEC, but she didn&#8217;t seem to mind&#8230;at all.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">And the kids aren&#8217;t the only ones that make this family special.  Mike and Niki were all laughs.  I decided to vote Mike top male model of the month.  For real,  check it out!  And Niki, you&#8217;re a strong beautiful woman!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">PS these are untouched in photoshop.  They really just look that good.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Talk about beautiful.  Mike couldn&#8217;t keep his hands off his wife.  He kept saying, &#8220;Man you are gorgeous, you are so hot&#8221;.  What a lucky lady.</p>
