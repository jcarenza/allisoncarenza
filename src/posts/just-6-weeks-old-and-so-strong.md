<p style="text-align: center;">It&#8217;s really no surprise that baby George is so strong. Â At just 6 weeks old he is going from his home in Scottsdale,Â to Kansas City, to New York City, and then back home to Arizona. Â With just his momma. Â Yup, Dad is at home working. Â Brand new momma Susie is oh so awesome for feeling comfortable and confident enough to travel so early. Â You rock Susie. Â During the shoot we joked that the pioneer women had to travel in a wagon, which makes her travel look easy. Â I still think it&#8217;s pretty impressive! Â That is why I think this little 6 week old is oh so strong&#8230;it&#8217;s in his blood. ðŸ™‚</p>

Â We managed to get a couple pictures of him with his eyes closed, but it was short lived, he didn&#8217;t want to miss anything.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">Oh George! Â You are so strong!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4741" alt="george3" src="/media/george3.jpg" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/george3.jpg 930w, /media/george3-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/george3-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nothing like a little momma love!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4742" alt="george4" src="/media/george4.jpg" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/george4.jpg 930w, /media/george4-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/george4-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" />I love getting to know my clients during our session. Â I learned that Susie is a graphic designer, that she just got done doing a full remodel on her home while she was the general contractor and very pregnant, and that she chose to deliver George without any pain killers. Â SEE strong!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I love these two!</p>
