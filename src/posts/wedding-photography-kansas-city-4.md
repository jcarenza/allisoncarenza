<p style="text-align: center;">Their first memory of each other is vague.  Nick remembers a horsey girl (ponytail, boots, maybe a little dirty)  out in the middle of the arena barking orders to kids to prepare them for the show.  He didn&apos;t really notice her at all because he was really there to watch his sister compete, after all Elizabeth was just his sister&apos;s trainer.  But later when they met face to face it was a whole different story.  He thought she was beautiful, and she thought he was hot.  But, they were both dating someone else at the time, so nothing happened.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Four years later when they were both single again, a friend suggested they get together.  They dated, and quickly fell in love, whether they knew it or not.  When Elizabeth went away to train with another Arabian trainer for 3 weeks in a different state it became obvious  to Nick that he couldn&apos;t, wouldn&apos;t live without this girl.  They talked constantly, so when she got home he asked ,&#8221;When are you movin&apos; to Marshall?&#8221; Her response, &#8220;When are you gonna ask?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">They&apos;re day was full of joy.  That&apos;s really the only way I can describe it.  They are both pretty laid back, down to Earth and all about fun!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Poor Nick.  The Saturday before the wedding I got an email from Elizabeth saying that Nick broke his leg and  that I needed to prepare to be creative for pics.  I guess the morning of the accident Elizabeth had told Nick to be careful on his 4 wheeler.  He was, but a freak accident left his 4 wheeler looking like this, and his leg in a full cast.  I guess he&apos;s lucky, cause the 4 wheeler is not.  We&apos;re also lucky his pants fit over the cast.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">After they got ready at the church we went to Nick&apos;s old family mansion.  This house was built sometime in the early to mid 1800&apos;s.  During the civil war it was used as a hospital.  In fact Nick&apos;s family had to sand down the wood floors to get the blood stains out.  If you look to the right you&apos;ll see a note that is written on the wall dated 1876.  It&apos;s a letter to someone saying their going to church, they will return if nothing happens to prevent.  It&apos;s kinda scary like they were going to go to church in the middle of a blizzard.  Really cool!  Also, the goomsmen that have stayed the night there are convinced it&apos;s haunted.  I guess they would wake up in the middle of the night hearing billiards being played downstairs, but there is no pool table.  eeeewwww!</p>
