<p style="text-align: center;">This is Claire!  And she had her pictures taken for her first birthday!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082" title="claire4" src="/media/claire4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Claire has a viabrant personality.   She is curious, excited, and overall happy.  Did I mention she loves to crawl.  SHE LOVES TO CRAWL and laugh at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1081" title="claire3" src="/media/claire3.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="400"   />She loves to crawl so much she spent most of her time crawling right off the set.   Lucky for me I had to fabulous parents on hand to pick her up and start her over...on the other side of the studio.  LOL</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">She also loves to point at EVERYTHING!  I love this picture I mean she&apos;s pointing at me, or the camera, doesn&apos;t get much better than that.  Susie and Cliff were so great at laughing right along with me.  You can&apos;t control kids and that&apos;s what makes their pictures so awesome!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1084" title="claire6" src="/media/claire6.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I know you&apos;re thinking the same thing as me.  Why doesn&apos;t Cliff have his toes painted too?  Don&apos;t forget to notice those adorable wrinkles on Claire&apos;s legs.  Perfection!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">We finished our shoot with a cake.  Everything in life should end with cake!  Some kids love cake some don&apos;t...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1079" title="claire1" src="/media/claire1.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="600"   />Claire loves cake!  I love the balloon in the pic!  Want one for your next shoot?  Just let me know, there is a secret place in downtown Blue Springs that can balloon anything.</p>
