<p>Meet little Christmas baby Keegan!  I&apos;ve know Keegan&apos;s momma Sarah since she was a tot herself.  We started our relationship at Sierra Stables in Indep, riding horses, and participating in a local 4 H group. Yup.  I was a 4H er.</p>
<p>It&apos;s hard to believe she is a mother now, and a great one at that.</p>
<p>Little Keegan was a dream baby during our shoot at my home studio in Lee&apos;s Summit.  He slept and cooed, and did all the most perfect little baby things.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48931" src="/media/Keegan1.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/Keegan1.jpg 930w, /media/Keegan1-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/Keegan1-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p>And did you notice all that newborn baby hair.  I just couldn&apos;t get enough.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48932" src="/media/Keegan2.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/Keegan2.jpg 930w, /media/Keegan2-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/Keegan2-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p>I never force a baby into a pose, but little Keegan felt so comfortable with his toes up under his arms.  Like he&apos;d been sitting like that for months.</p>

<p>Sarah you are going to have such a great time with little Keegan.  He will be the greatest experience of your life.</p>
