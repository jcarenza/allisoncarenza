<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">There are definitely some tricks to getting a newborn to relax and feel comfortable during a shoot, and today I want to share those with you. Â Not having kids of my own, I have learned these little jewels of knowledge through experience, and I would love to help someone else skip a few of my stumbles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">First of all, I only shoot in the first 9 days. Â After that, they seem to wake up and squirm, and cry, and not like to be put in uncomfortable positions. Â So when a mother to be contacts me I schedule the session for about a week after her due date, and typically during the week so I have a little more wiggle room. Â I think they are the very best between 4 and 7 days old, but I also want the new parents to feel comfortable traveling.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A few days before the shoot I tell the parents to try to wear the little one out the morning of the shoot, by giving them a bathe, going to a friends house, or just taking a walk. Â This is so hard, almost impossible, and I know you really can&apos;t entertain a newborn, let alone wear them out, but it&apos;s the effort that counts, and sometimes it works, and the babes come to me all ready for a couple hours of floppy sleep. Â ðŸ™‚</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I also tell the moms to feed about an hour before our shoot so they are in between feedings when they arrive. Â If need be, we can start with feeding, but usually after a car ride they are good for a few shots, and sometimes a whole session. Â But, my general rule is to get them as full as a tick. Â The fuller the better.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The day of the shoot the baby really dictates the mood and pace. Â I have a massage table blanket warmer, like this one <a href="http://http://www.amazon.com/Earthlite-Basics-Fleece-Massage-Warmer/dp/B00122JDXU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323193160&amp;sr=8-1">here</a>. Â A white noise maker, like this one <a href="http://http://www.amazon.com/Marpac-SleepMate-980A-Electro-Mechanical-Conditioner/dp/B000KUHFGM/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323193219&amp;sr=1-1">here</a>. Â And lots of blankets and wraps to swaddle the little one. Â I also have a baby poser from <a href="http://http://www.amandarachael.com/bellabun.shtml">Bella bun</a>. Â I love it to pieces, and the babies seem to as well. Â I&apos;ve even had parents tell me they were going to buy their own bella bun!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">There is really no right way to comfort a newborn since they are all so different, it&apos;s really just about being patient, maintaining a positive attitude and having fun, because really even if the baby is fussy and cries the whole session I always end up getting some good shots, and I&apos;m doing what I love. Â And really, what else matters?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I hope this helps, happy shooting!</p>
