<p style="text-align: center;">Lindsey and Cole Amaya share a love for the outdoors, their friends, Kansas City, having fun, and The Chiefs, and surprises, did I mention they like surprises.  Yes, they love to surprise their friends and family, like when they had the KC wolf crash their wedding.  It was a surprise, a really really awesome surprise.  I don&apos;t have time to share every single pic, or I would because they are that fun.  It was epic, and having the wolf there totally got the party started.  I think the KC wolf surprise sums up their relationship.  Fun!  All about having fun!  In fact Jon and I had a blast shooting this wedding.  I just have a few to share, but there are sooo many more.  Lindsey and Cole I LOVED being a part of your big day!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">During the wedding ceremony the light came pouring in through this massive stain glass window at the <a href="http://www.woodschapelchurch.org/">Wood Chapel Methodist Church</a>.  Such a beautiful affect.</p>
