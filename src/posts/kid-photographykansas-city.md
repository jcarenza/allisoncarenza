<p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes kids come into the studio timid, fearful, and downright scared.  Ok I take that back, most of the time kids, that are new, come in that way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I mean really I&apos;d be scared too.  Imagine from their point of view, a big dark room, a big scary box things that shoots light, sitting in the middle of a room while  a crazy lady aims a big black thing at you.   All the while your parents are in the background acting crazy and telling you to smile.  I&apos;d be intimidated too.   Baby girl Brooksley was no different.  She was attached to her mom Beth like a leech.  So we just played.  And after a few minutes here are the shots we started getting. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956" title="b4" src="/media/b4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600"   /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Brooksley has beautiful red hair and big brown eyes as you can see.  The camera loves her!  And after a short time, she was starting to love the camera.  Just look.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">She even stuck her tongue out.  I think we told her to make a funny face.  Job well done Brooksley! <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955" title="b3" src="/media/b3.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="400"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The picture below is something powerful to me.  I look at it as a baby no longer a baby.  Ready to get rid of the Bumbo and stand on her own.  Makes me take a deep breath and give thanks that I captured this awesome moment.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959" title="b7" src="/media/b7.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="600"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Brooksley you are beautiful!  Thanks for making your pictures so easy to take!</p>
