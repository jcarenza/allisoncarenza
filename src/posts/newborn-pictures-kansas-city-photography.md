<p style="text-align: center;">Meet darling Amy!    She&apos;s a new mom, and a military mom at that.  When we did her maternity pictures she was so much fun.  Since it was just the two of us it was some seriously good girl time!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2121" title="amy1" src="/media/amy1.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He hubby Isaiah was in Afghanistan during the session.  In fact, he was fighting a war the whole time she was pregnant.  That is why I think Amy is one of the strongest women...ever!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2124" title="amy4" src="/media/amy4.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I mean, she didn&apos;t have anyone to pamper her, to listen to her complain about the troubles of pregnancy, to get her midnight ice cream, or to yell at just because.  I know I couldn&apos;t do it, but Amy was good real good.  Happy even.  That&apos;s what I love about her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2123" title="amy3" src="/media/amy3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Luckily Isaiah was able to come home for the delivery of his first born.  But not by much.  Little baby did not want to come out, and Amy was induced just a week before Isaiah was scheduled to go back to war.  In fact we took baby Aden&apos;s newborn pictures the day before he was scheduled to return.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Aden.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;m so happy we were able to get their pictures done, because Isaiah is such a nice guy, and a great dad!  It was so fun watching these new parents adore their baby.  In fact, I had to tell them to stop looking at the baby and look at the camera.  Pretty funny.  Ok look here. Click. They immediately look down.  Hilarious.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Remember how I said Amy was strong.  Yah I wasn&apos;t kidding she delivered Aden naturally.  Not because she wanted to prove something, but because she was just moving through labor without much problem.  Then she decided an epidural was a good idea, but it was too late. She was 9.5 and ready to push.  WHAT A WOMAN!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">There are about 20 amazing pics of Aden and Isaiah.  I feel so lucky to have gotten to capture these amazing moments!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I love funny people and Amy is definitely funny.   We were talking about how Aden is a bit jaundice and Amy&apos;s response was that he&apos;s even more yellow than normal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Pretty funny!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Aden was such a perfect little model, I finished the shoot feeling totally spoiled.  I loved all my time with this family, and look forward to many more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Isaiah my thoughts are with you and I&apos;m wishing you a quick and safe return!  xoxo</p>
