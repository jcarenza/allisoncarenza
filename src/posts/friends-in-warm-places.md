<p style="text-align: center;">When Sally told me she was moving to south Florida for Matt&apos;s job, I was disappointed, understanding, and happy... because she was moving somewhere warm, and let&apos;s be honest, when you live in KC, you need friends in warm places.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The move made me realize that distance, and time between seeing each other changed nothing in our relationship.  However, the kids that I adore and value are growing up so fast!  I&apos;m just so glad we were able to grab some time while they were in town to capture some of these fleeting moments!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Faith you are the most adorable.  You are so close to my heart.  xoxo</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Mason is definitely a Plaster, and Addy is a mini Faith.</p>
