<p style="text-align: center;">23 eggs. Â There were 23 eggs in the beginning, but slowly they started to parish. Â One by one, until there were only 5, then 4, then 3, then 2, and finally one. Â One egg. Â One chance, that&apos;s all they had. Â In vitro is risky enough, but with just one egg the odds weren&apos;t in Pam and Scott&apos;s favor. Â But as it turns out, one egg is enough. Â In fact it&apos;s the perfect amount. Â I didn&apos;t get to meet Pam and Scott before they were pregnant, Â but I know they must have been changed forever when they finally got the good news after years of trying.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I guess dreams do come true...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">meet lucky Gavin! Â He&apos;s the one and only, and the lucky boy to have landed in the arms of two very appreciative parents!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1973" title="siems3" src="/media/siems3.jpg" alt="" width="752" height="499" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So strong!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1975" title="siems5" src="/media/siems5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;m not that into airplanes, but Scott flies the plane on Gavin&apos;s onsie in this picture. Â It&apos;s the one that flies over the Chiefs stadium. Â I think that&apos;s pretty cool! Â I think he&apos;s going to want to be just like his Daddy when he gets a little older.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1977" title="siems7" src="/media/siems7.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Giddy! Â That&apos;s how I would describe these new parents. Â Pam didn&apos;t even seem tired, just happy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1976" title="siems6" src="/media/siems6.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499" /><a rel="attachment wp-att-1972" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1970/siems2"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If he seems a little chunky that&apos;s because he downed 4 ounces of milk before he was happy. Â I think he&apos;s going to be a big boy! Â Dang, you go Gavin!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1972" title="siems2" src="/media/siems2.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Big appetite and big hands. Â Yup, I see ball sports in his future.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1974" title="siems4" src="/media/siems4.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Scott, Pam and Gavin, I am touched forever by your story. Â Thank you so much for coming to me for your maternity and newborn pictures. Â I look forward to many more laughs in the studio, and 4 ounce feedings. ðŸ™‚</p>
