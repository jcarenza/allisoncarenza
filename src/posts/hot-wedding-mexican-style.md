<p style="text-align: center;">With 12 of their closest friends there to witness, and the warm sea breeze at their backs, Cara and Ian tied the knot.  They decided the ONLY way to get married was on the beach.  After watching the wedding I think they were entirely right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It&apos;s really hard for me to put into words the love I witnesses on this sunny June day.  I will try to show you, but even these beautiful pics can&apos;t do their wedding justice.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">You see, despite the allure of the puffy white clouds, the big blue sky, and the impossibly beautiful turquoise water my attention was entirely on Cara and Ian. They were lost...in each other.  I think a hurricane could have blown in behind them and they would have never noticed.  They were all smiles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Not only were they giddy, but also totally entertained by each other.  Made my job easy.  Most of their pics are just them, being them.  Our trip to Mexico is one I&apos;ll never forget!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Love you guys and your love.  So happy I was your photographer.</p>
