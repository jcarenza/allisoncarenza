<p style="text-align: center;">I wish I had a crazy awesome picture of a little one in a turkey costume on this warm Thanksgiving, but instead I have something pretty close. Â I mean he&apos;s cute, adorable really, but the theme is much more xmas, kinda like the macy&apos;s parade. Â ðŸ™‚</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is little Wyatt with his two crazy in love parents! Â I haven&apos;t seen Wyatt since he was itty bitty, but he is just as cute if not cuter! Â He was oh so photogenic during our shoot. Â Just see for yourself!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Oh and check out those little teeth.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Wyatt loves his daddy too! Â I have no doubt he&apos;ll want to grow up to be just like him. Â  See they live on a farm and his dad models hard work all year long. Â I have a soft spot in my heart for farm boys. Â They&apos;re always so tough, hard working, and never bored!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3612" title="tyre2" src="/media/tyre2.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3613" title="tyre3" src="/media/tyre3.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3614" title="tyre4" src="/media/tyre4.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">At the end of the shoot we wanted to get a few with his bear hat, but he wasn&apos;t havin&apos; it, so we quickly Â took it off, and he was all smiles again. Â I love this little boy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615" title="tyre5" src="/media/tyre5.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3620" title="tyre6" src="/media/tyre6.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am so lucky to be the photographer that gets to photograph this little guy! Â He is pure perfection. Â And the parents are pretty fun too!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Happy Thanksgiving!!!!</p>
