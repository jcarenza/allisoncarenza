<p style="text-align: center;">I fell in love with Mariah a few years ago when I was taking her sister Olivia&apos;s senior pictures.  She came along with her mom Michele to watch, and maybe torment her sister a bit, but really just to make the shoot a good time.  There are those that have a great personality and then there are those that have a great big personality, and Mariah definitely fits in that category. She is 110% fun, and I loved every second of our shoot together.  In fact, I&apos;m pretty sure my face started hurting from laughing so much!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mariah is a senior and next year she&apos;ll be going to Bradley University.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">She has that sparkle in her eyes, I think it&apos;s her love for life and love for others, what a special gift.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Mariah chose Unity Village for her senior pictures and the light was GORgeous!  I used a little fill flash camera left on the the image on the right.  I love all the gooey golden light.</p>
