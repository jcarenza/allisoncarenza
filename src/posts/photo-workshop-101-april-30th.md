<p style="text-align: center;">Workshop time!  Calling all hobby/amatuer photogs ready to take better pics.  This workshop is for all ya&apos;ll that look at your photos and think &#8220;what the?&#8221;.  I&apos;ll be putting my teaching shoes on for another day of fun.  Below are a few shots Jon boy snapped last fall.  If the content is boring I promise I will not be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We&apos;ll be learning all the technical mumbo jumbo in the morning, I&apos;ll give you a few creative guidelines and you&apos;ll have time to shoot.  Last time I was uber impressed with the quality of work the class turned out.  They were artists in the making.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Jon boy was our model last time, but this time I think I&apos;ll have some real models.  Or just hot friends.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to answer all your questions.</p>
