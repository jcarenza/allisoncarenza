<p style="text-align: center;">Meet baby Sullivan.  At just 8 days old we can already tell so much about little Sullivan.  He&apos;s got big hands and huge feet like a labrador puppy, which means he&apos;s probably going to be a big boy.  In fact his hands were so big, I had trouble working with them, mixed with the fact that he liked his fingers balled up.  I eventually gave up and let him curl his hand under his chin.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">He&apos;s also very loved!</p>
