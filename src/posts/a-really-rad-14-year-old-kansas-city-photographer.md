<p style="text-align: center;">Last Saturday I had the opportunity to meet one of the radest 14 year olds ever! Â Not only is he good looking, a nationally ranked track star, and super cool, but he was nice. Â Really nice. Â What a fierce combination.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Lj. Â He popped a few moves for me before the end of the session. Â He&apos;s a great dancer too!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">And yet, he&apos;s still a kid with braces and he knows it. Â I love his humble and real attitude about life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He didn&apos;t really want to cheese up the camera at first, but I was in a silly mood, and he couldn&apos;t resist. Â ðŸ™‚</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">These are actually his dad Lonnie&apos;s sunglasses. Â I thought they looked great!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3330" title="j5" src="/media/j55.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">LJ, I have no doubt you will achieve great things. Â Take care of yourself as you go through these hard years. Â We&apos;re all cheering you on!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
