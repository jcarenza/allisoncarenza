<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Sarah and Matthew.  Two happy people, happy to be in love, and even more happy to be pregnant.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1287" title="vin3" src="/media/vin3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/vin3.jpg 700w, /media/vin3-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Some women seem to be nervous when they&apos;re pregnant, or anxious, or just down right scared.  That would be me.  But Sarah was at ease and so very excited to be a mom.  I think you can tell from the pictures that she has definitely got the love gene.  She has so much to give.  Matthew just soaks it up.  During our sometimes I felt like they didn&apos;t even notice I was there.  They are a real unit, and little Tavin is lucky to have them as parents.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Sarah and Matthew I wish you the best of luck as parents not that you&apos;ll need it.  Just keep loving eachother the way you already do!</p>
