<p style="text-align: center;">From the soft hair on their shoulder, to the light flakey skin on their feet, and the teeny tiny finger nails, I love photographing newborns.  Every little part of them is perfection, and I just can&apos;t get enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4134" title="merrick4" src="/media/merrick4.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Some times the 9 day olds even give me a bright eyed look right into the camera, but it&apos;s oh so rare.  Little Eleanor was all about having her picture taken even when she was awake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4132" title="merrick2" src="/media/merrick2.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And then of course there&apos;s that mother daughter moment.  This picture is timeless.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4131" title="merrick1" src="/media/merrick1.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Merrick and Eleanor I had a blast taking your first pictures.  You are perfection through and through.  Come back and see me soon!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
