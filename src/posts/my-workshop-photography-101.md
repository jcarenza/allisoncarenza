<p style="text-align: left;">It&apos;s like the first day of school all over again.  The night before the<a href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/workshops"> workshop</a> I stress over what to wear, I revise and re revise my plans, I worry about technology, and of course whether or not the students will like me.  This is particularly bad now since the students are big people...grown ups.  But the morning of the workshop I wake up pumped, ready to get my teach on.  There is a kind of peace that comes over me because I know that whatever happens I&apos;m going to do my best to share the knowledge I&apos;ve acquired from so many great photogs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We started the day going over all the yucky technical stuff.  It&apos;s boring, hard to learn, but the most important part of the day.  I tried to throw a couple silly stories in there to mix it up.  And I didn&apos;t really care if they were laughing with me or at me as long as they were laughing.  I also tried to get everyone up and moving around a lot.  Very important for my ADD!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After we got all the technical stuff out of the way, we ate lunch and got into the good stuff.  The art of photography.  How to use the technical info they learned to compose pics that are professional looking.  Then they got to go out and shoot around the city.  What may look like dirty city to the average eye is actually full of potential wall art.  Here are just a few of my favorites.  I was so very very impressed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nice color, and texture!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2674" title="DSC_0059" src="/media/DSC_0059.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/DSC_0059.jpg 700w, /media/DSC_0059-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Frannie found a cool double reflection.  Made me stop and stare for awhile.  The pic on the right has emotion.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2680" title="Untitled-1" src="/media/Untitled-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/Untitled-1.jpg 700w, /media/Untitled-1-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dirty water, but so well composed.  I even like the distracting cross on the right.  Could be a sign from God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2677" title="IMG_1381" src="/media/IMG_1381.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="/media/IMG_1381.jpg 750w, /media/IMG_1381-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nice!  The pic looks like it was done in photoshop HDR style, but nope.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2683" title="Untitled-4" src="/media/Untitled-4.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/Untitled-4.jpg 700w, /media/Untitled-4-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">IPAS&apos;s store cat.  She was all about having her pic taken.  Loving the contrast here and the composition is nice too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2678" title="IMG_1393" src="/media/IMG_1393.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="/media/IMG_1393.jpg 750w, /media/IMG_1393-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Interesting and well composed!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2681" title="Untitled-2" src="/media/Untitled-2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/Untitled-2.jpg 700w, /media/Untitled-2-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">COLOR!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2676" title="DSC_6719" src="/media/DSC_6719.jpg" alt="" width="753" height="500" srcset="/media/DSC_6719.jpg 753w, /media/DSC_6719-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Right on!  I could tell they were really finding interesting angles!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2682" title="Untitled-3" src="/media/Untitled-3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/Untitled-3.jpg 700w, /media/Untitled-3-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the afternoon we went back outside so I could model some portrait  photography.  I showed them how to hunt for the good light.  I think we did a pretty good job of finding the good stuff.  This was at about 3pm so not the most favorable time of day for gooey light.  Just goes to show, good light can happen at any time of day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2684" title="ws1" src="/media/ws11.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="500" srcset="/media/ws11.jpg 693w, /media/ws11-300x216.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I just wish I&apos;d taken everybody&apos;s pic!  Frannie was fierce and this light was too.  Bouncing all over the place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2685" title="ws2" src="/media/ws21.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="500" srcset="/media/ws21.jpg 743w, /media/ws21-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Alissa on the left was laughing all day, and I loved it.  Happy pregnant people make me smile.  The pic of Lindsey on the right was taken a la natural.  The light was peeking over the building behind her hitting a window that was reflecting onto the ground and bounding up on her face.  Gorgeous!  Finds like this light are hard to come by.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2686" title="ws3" src="/media/ws31.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="500" srcset="/media/ws31.jpg 693w, /media/ws31-300x216.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thank you Lindsey, Frannie, Alissa, Sue, Kim, Jim, Kathy, Melissa, Llana and Jon!  You made this a great day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Oh and mother nature.  You rock too!</p>
