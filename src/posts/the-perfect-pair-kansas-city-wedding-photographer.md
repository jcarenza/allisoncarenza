<p style="text-align: center;">Rose was searching, for her knight in shining armor, her best friend, tall, dark, and handsome.  And she wasn&apos;t willing to settle for anything less than the man of her dreams.  So when she met Dana for the first time, she knew he was the one.  Dana was just as smitten.  After a few dates he admitted to Rose that the first time he saw her across the room, his eyes popped out of his head, much like Roger Rabbit the first time he saw Jessica.  Wowza!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It may have taken them awhile to find each other, but now that they have, they aren&apos;t wasting any time.  They just love to be together.  Dana loves to make Rose laugh, and Rose loves to watch Dana do his thing.  She&apos;s all smiles when he&apos;s around.  Their wedding was about bringing two people, and two families together.  It was joyous, beautiful, and all about their bond.</p>
