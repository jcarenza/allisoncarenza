<p style="text-align: center;">Photography is my passion, my air, my dream, my reality.  Not so much Jon&#8217;s.  But it doesn&#8217;t stop him from helping me any chance he gets.  Most the time it&#8217;s on location or in the studio, carrying gear, holding reflectors, adjusting light stands and moving backdrops and props around.  But, really his biggest job is to bounce around behind the camera getting the attention of kids and adults of all ages.  He&#8217;s pretty much a natural, and I can always count on his beautiful mug to bring out a smile with even the most serious babies.  They love him.  He&#8217;s a bit of a kid magnet.  And I love that about him.  Even more than all his free time he puts in to help me with my business even though he doesn&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here&#8217;s a picture taken this weekend!  The little guy insisted Jon come over and sit by him.</p>
