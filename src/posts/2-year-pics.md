<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;ve been taking Lindley&apos;s pics since she was just a week old.  Now she&apos;s two, with a huge personality and bright eyes that scream I want to have fun.  Taking pictures of a two year old is a trip.  I find it&apos;s best to just find a location where we can be moving, constantly.  And moving we were, here, there, and everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I met Marisa, Cory, and Lindley at Antioch park in KS, a new location for me, but I loved it, so many great photo ops with great light, a beautiful pond, and little ducklings too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4936" alt="rob6" src="/media/rob6.jpg" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/rob6.jpg 930w, /media/rob6-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/rob6-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When I&apos;m photographing a 2 year old I have to be fast, and usually I don&apos;t have any idea what I got, really, so I just keep shooting and hoping I captured that moment, the one that best represents the little.  I totally think this image represents Lindley at this time in her life.  Beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4934" alt="rob4" src="/media/rob4.jpg" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/rob4.jpg 930w, /media/rob4-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/rob4-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Maris is such a great momma.  LIke mother earth. She&apos;s amazing  What a great moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And there&apos;s Lindley biting that bottom lip again.  So cute.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4933" alt="rob3" src="/media/rob3.jpg" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/rob3.jpg 930w, /media/rob3-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/rob3-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Most of the time we were chasing Lindley and trying to keep her from joining the geese in the pond.  This kid has no fear, and she&apos;s fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4932" alt="rob2" src="/media/rob2.jpg" width="930" height="680" srcset="/media/rob2.jpg 930w, /media/rob2-300x219.jpg 300w, /media/rob2-768x562.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Love this moment.  We had to chase down Lindley a couple times, but we manages to pull one off.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4931" alt="rob1" src="/media/rob1.jpg" width="930" height="680" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4935" alt="rob5" src="/media/rob5.jpg" width="930" height="680" />Oh how I love photographing 2 year olds.  Lindley you&apos;re a doll! xoxo</p>
