<p>It started with a photo shoot or two. Â My awesome cooperating teacher from my student teaching days wanted me to take pictures of her adorable 5 year old daughter Stella. Â I was all, absolutely, but they live in Fulton. Â 2 hours away, in our old college town. Â But another client wanted to do pics in St. Louis as well, so I planned on stopping in Fulton taking pics and then driving to St. Louis Â for another shoot. Â Then we would get to see Jon&apos;s fam. Â Perfect right? Â Not quite my St. Louis client had to reschedule due to unexpected business travel, so I was going to have to reschedule Â Kara&apos;s shoot as well. Â I was disappointed with a capital D. Â Whenever something disappointing or discouraging comes up I try to turn it into something even better. Â So I thought hmmm...and then it hit me, Jon and I hadn&apos;t celebrated our anniversary, in fact, we hadn&apos;t had alone time in FOREVER. Â We constantly joke about the date night that never seems to happen. Â So I decided to book a b and b in small town Rocheport and enjoy an afternoon sipping wine at the A frame at Les Bourgeois winery. Â The day was even more perfect than originally planned. Â I love when something expected turns into something wonderfully unexpected. Â Perfection with a capital P.</p>
<p>I hope that after seeing the pics you are excited to take your own trip to little Rocheport where the wine goes down easy and the light is always golden. Â Let me tell you more about my day.</p>
<p>At about noon after scoping out some great spots we started our shoot with the Wagner clan. Â They are a happy bunch and Stella is about as photogenic as they get. Â Here are just a few from our shoot. Â I really couldn&apos;t pick because there were somewhere around 60 perfect pictures! Â But here are some favs, maybe later I&apos;ll post the rest on a slide show.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1306" title="wag3" src="/media/wag3.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Stella wasn&apos;t afraid to work it. Â No coaching was involved. Â This little one is oozing with confidence. Â Hold on to it girl, you rock!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1311" title="wag8" src="/media/wag8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For sure Daddy&apos;s little girl. Â  Stella adores Jason</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305" title="wag2" src="/media/wag2.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I just love it when kids do there thing. Â I&apos;m just happy I had my camera ready to capture this Stella moment!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1310" title="wag7" src="/media/wag7.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If you know Stella this is her smile, warm and radiant. Â She doesn&apos;t mess around with grumpy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1307" title="wag4" src="/media/wag4.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">PS her toenails are purple too! Â LOVE IT! Â Sparkly purple toes are pretty close to perfection.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1308" title="wag5" src="/media/wag5.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Kara and Stella have such a bond. Â I just know they&apos;ll always be close.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1309" title="wag6" src="/media/wag6.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Stella was amazing the whole time, but I think by the time we were done she was pooped, but still smiling! Â Sometimes ya just gotta lay on a log.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304" title="wag1" src="/media/wag1.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;m so happy we made this happen. Â Kara your family is great and I look forward to more pics with Stella in the future!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">After the shoot we headed back to Rocheport for some much needed down time. Â Of course I took my camera, even though Jon probably wouldn&apos;t have minded my leaving it in the car. Â I had to play with my new lens. Â Here are some pics I got. Â Ahh it&apos;s relaxing thinking about it. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.missouriwine.com/">Les Bourgeois</a> is a fun winery and if you&apos;re ever driving through the state it&apos;s worth a stop off. Â You can sit under a tree at a picnic table high on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri river, drinking wine and eating cheese.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1319" title="roch8" src="/media/roch8.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I love my hot hubby&apos;s mug! Â He has a great looking smirk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1313" title="roch2" src="/media/roch2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">My favorite summer wine. Â Sweet and refreshing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1316" title="roch5" src="/media/roch5.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">After we checked into our little B and B, Â Jon needed a nap and I needed to catch some of this light before it was gone. Â So I took off down the street of this small town. Â The whole town is only a few blocks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1315" title="roch4" src="/media/roch4.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rocheport.com/">Rocheport</a> isn&apos;t on the bluffs like the winery, it&apos;s down in the valley, right by the river. Â So the evening light comes in and fills the valley with this gooey golden light that makes everything look amazing. Â Even old chairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1318" title="roch7" src="/media/roch7.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Everything in Rocheport is quaint and middle America. Â I wish I could have seen the town in it&apos;s booming railroad days. Â The railroad tracks are now a part of the 225 mileÂ <a href="http://www.bikekatytrail.com/">Katy Trail</a>. Â You can walk it or bike it. Â I would love to go back and bike it this fall when the leaves are changing colors. Â There is an old railroad tunnel that totally gave me the creepers. Â I felt so unsafe walking through it. Â Obviously there isn&apos;t tracks, so no train was going to come through, but it sure felt like it. Â I regret not getting a picture of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1321" title="roch10" src="/media/roch10.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is our bed and breakfast. Â The <a href="http://www.schoolhousebb.com/?tracker=googlelocal">Schoolhouse</a> was built in 1914, but you would never know. Â The owners have done a fabulous job of keeping it up, and thinking of every little detail to make the stay memorable. Â The bed was great, the heart shaped jacuzzi was better, and I loved the breakfast. Â We will definitely come back for another stay in a different room.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1320" title="roch9" src="/media/roch9.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Old is cool!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1314" title="roch3" src="/media/roch3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I didn&apos;t get a pic of <a href="http://abigails-restaurant.com/">Abigail&apos;s</a> but I want to give them a shout out for the great meal. Â It&apos;s the only place to eat on a Sunday evening, but I would go back any day of the week. Â Everything was made fresh, in fact, the menu was on a white board with things scratched out as they ran out. Â And our dessert menu was handed to us on an index card.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1317" title="roch6" src="/media/roch6.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is one of the most perfect spots for pictures the light was gorgeous. Â I told Jon we had to take a pic. Â So I se my camera up on a gate and focused and hoped for the best. Â I really want someone to get married in Rocheport so we can do pics here!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1312" title="roch1" src="/media/roch1.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jon and I had a great time, but I&apos;m ready to go back. Â There&apos;s something appealing about the simple life of a small town.</p>
