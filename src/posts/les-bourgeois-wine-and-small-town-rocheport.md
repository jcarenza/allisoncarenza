<p>It started with a photo shoot or two. Â My awesome cooperating teacher from my student teaching days wanted me to take pictures of her adorable 5 year old daughter Stella. Â I was all, absolutely, but they live in Fulton. Â 2 hours away, in our old college town. Â But another client wanted to do pics in St. Louis as well, so I planned on stopping in Fulton taking pics and then driving to St. Louis Â for another shoot. Â Then we would get to see Jon&#8217;s fam. Â Perfect right? Â Not quite my St. Louis client had to reschedule due to unexpected business travel, so I was going to have to reschedule Â Kara&#8217;s shoot as well. Â I was disappointed with a capital D. Â Whenever something disappointing or discouraging comes up I try to turn it into something even better. Â So I thought hmmm&#8230;and then it hit me, Jon and I hadn&#8217;t celebrated our anniversary, in fact, we hadn&#8217;t had alone time in FOREVER. Â We constantly joke about the date night that never seems to happen. Â So I decided to book a b and b in small town Rocheport and enjoy an afternoon sipping wine at the A frame at Les Bourgeois winery. Â The day was even more perfect than originally planned. Â I love when something expected turns into something wonderfully unexpected. Â Perfection with a capital P.</p>
<p>I hope that after seeing the pics you are excited to take your own trip to little Rocheport where the wine goes down easy and the light is always golden. Â Let me tell you more about my day.</p>
<p>At about noon after scoping out some great spots we started our shoot with the Wagner clan. Â They are a happy bunch and Stella is about as photogenic as they get. Â Here are just a few from our shoot. Â I really couldn&#8217;t pick because there were somewhere around 60 perfect pictures! Â But here are some favs, maybe later I&#8217;ll post the rest on a slide show.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Stella wasn&#8217;t afraid to work it. Â No coaching was involved. Â This little one is oozing with confidence. Â Hold on to it girl, you rock!</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1311" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/wag8"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1311" title="wag8" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wag8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/wag8.jpg 700w, /media/wag8-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For sure Daddy&#8217;s little girl. Â  Stella adores Jason</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1305" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/wag2"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305" title="wag2" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wag2.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="/media/wag2.jpg 750w, /media/wag2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I just love it when kids do there thing. Â I&#8217;m just happy I had my camera ready to capture this Stella moment!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1310" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/wag7"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1310" title="wag7" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wag7.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="/media/wag7.jpg 750w, /media/wag7-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If you know Stella this is her smile, warm and radiant. Â She doesn&#8217;t mess around with grumpy.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1307" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/wag4"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1307" title="wag4" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wag4.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500" srcset="/media/wag4.jpg 751w, /media/wag4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">PS her toenails are purple too! Â LOVE IT! Â Sparkly purple toes are pretty close to perfection.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1308" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/wag5"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1308" title="wag5" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wag5.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/wag5.jpg 700w, /media/wag5-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Kara and Stella have such a bond. Â I just know they&#8217;ll always be close.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1309" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/wag6"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1309" title="wag6" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wag6.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="/media/wag6.jpg 750w, /media/wag6-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Stella was amazing the whole time, but I think by the time we were done she was pooped, but still smiling! Â Sometimes ya just gotta lay on a log.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1304" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/wag1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304" title="wag1" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wag1.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="/media/wag1.jpg 750w, /media/wag1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&#8217;m so happy we made this happen. Â Kara your family is great and I look forward to more pics with Stella in the future!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">After the shoot we headed back to Rocheport for some much needed down time. Â Of course I took my camera, even though Jon probably wouldn&#8217;t have minded my leaving it in the car. Â I had to play with my new lens. Â Here are some pics I got. Â Ahh it&#8217;s relaxing thinking about it. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.missouriwine.com/">Les Bourgeois</a> is a fun winery and if you&#8217;re ever driving through the state it&#8217;s worth a stop off. Â You can sit under a tree at a picnic table high on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri river, drinking wine and eating cheese.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1319" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/roch8"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1319" title="roch8" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/roch8.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500" srcset="/media/roch8.jpg 751w, /media/roch8-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I love my hot hubby&#8217;s mug! Â He has a great looking smirk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1313" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/roch2"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1313" title="roch2" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/roch2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/roch2.jpg 700w, /media/roch2-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">My favorite summer wine. Â Sweet and refreshing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1316" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/roch5"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1316" title="roch5" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/roch5.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500" srcset="/media/roch5.jpg 751w, /media/roch5-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">After we checked into our little B and B, Â Jon needed a nap and I needed to catch some of this light before it was gone. Â So I took off down the street of this small town. Â The whole town is only a few blocks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1315" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/roch4"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1315" title="roch4" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/roch4.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/roch4.jpg 700w, /media/roch4-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rocheport.com/">Rocheport</a> isn&#8217;t on the bluffs like the winery, it&#8217;s down in the valley, right by the river. Â So the evening light comes in and fills the valley with this gooey golden light that makes everything look amazing. Â Even old chairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1318" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/roch7"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1318" title="roch7" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/roch7.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500" srcset="/media/roch7.jpg 751w, /media/roch7-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Everything in Rocheport is quaint and middle America. Â I wish I could have seen the town in it&#8217;s booming railroad days. Â The railroad tracks are now a part of the 225 mileÂ <a href="http://www.bikekatytrail.com/">Katy Trail</a>. Â You can walk it or bike it. Â I would love to go back and bike it this fall when the leaves are changing colors. Â There is an old railroad tunnel that totally gave me the creepers. Â I felt so unsafe walking through it. Â Obviously there isn&#8217;t tracks, so no train was going to come through, but it sure felt like it. Â I regret not getting a picture of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1321" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/roch10"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1321" title="roch10" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/roch10.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/roch10.jpg 700w, /media/roch10-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is our bed and breakfast. Â The <a href="http://www.schoolhousebb.com/?tracker=googlelocal">Schoolhouse</a> was built in 1914, but you would never know. Â The owners have done a fabulous job of keeping it up, and thinking of every little detail to make the stay memorable. Â The bed was great, the heart shaped jacuzzi was better, and I loved the breakfast. Â We will definitely come back for another stay in a different room.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1320" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/roch9"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1320" title="roch9" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/roch9.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="/media/roch9.jpg 750w, /media/roch9-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Old is cool!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1314" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/roch3"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1314" title="roch3" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/roch3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="/media/roch3.jpg 700w, /media/roch3-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I didn&#8217;t get a pic of <a href="http://abigails-restaurant.com/">Abigail&#8217;s</a> but I want to give them a shout out for the great meal. Â It&#8217;s the only place to eat on a Sunday evening, but I would go back any day of the week. Â Everything was made fresh, in fact, the menu was on a white board with things scratched out as they ran out. Â And our dessert menu was handed to us on an index card.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1317" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/roch6"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1317" title="roch6" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/roch6.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500" srcset="/media/roch6.jpg 751w, /media/roch6-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is one of the most perfect spots for pictures the light was gorgeous. Â I told Jon we had to take a pic. Â So I se my camera up on a gate and focused and hoped for the best. Â I really want someone to get married in Rocheport so we can do pics here!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1312" href="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/archives/1303/roch1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1312" title="roch1" src="http://www.allisoncarenza.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/roch1.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500" srcset="/media/roch1.jpg 751w, /media/roch1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jon and I had a great time, but I&#8217;m ready to go back. Â There&#8217;s something appealing about the simple life of a small town.</p>
