<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Riley!  Looking at this adorable pic you might find it hard to believe she&apos;s just a newborn.  The seriousness of this expression belongs on the cover of a magazine, or CD.  But I find it perfect.  It&apos;s like she&apos;s saying, please give me a bottle...  or hold me... or wrap me in a warm blanket so I can sleep the afternoon away.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Riley was so perfect the whole shoot.  She was a model model, minus the fact that she refused to go to sleep.  Most my babies do.  I think I have too much energy to make them fall asleep.  As long as the little ones stay happy I&apos;m happy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This is Riley with her daddy Jody.  It is already so obvious she is going to be daddy&apos;s little girl!  Jody absolutely adores her, from her perfect tiny toes, to her perfect little eyelashes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Janee is equally obsessed.  She seemed to have so much intuition about Riley&apos;s needs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Janee and Jody thanks so much for giving me the chance to take these pics.  I hope you cherish them forever.  I&apos;m excited to watch Riley grow.</p>
