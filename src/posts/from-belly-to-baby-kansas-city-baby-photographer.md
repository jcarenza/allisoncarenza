<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Amber.  An ambitious, hard working, fun- loving, party girl, after my own heart.  Even before the shoot I knew we would hit it off.  I could just tell through the emails.  And I was right.  She oozes happy and it totally shows in her maternity pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3348" title="amber5" src="/media/amber5.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Her boyfriend Steven knows what he has in Amber, and is pretty goo goo ga ga over her.  They make a great couple, and and even better set of parents.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3345" title="amber2" src="/media/amber2.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3346" title="amber3" src="/media/amber3.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3347" title="amber4" src="/media/amber4.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I was pretty much in love with the couple after the maternity pics, so when the brought me Maxwell at just 5 days old, I was over the moon!  If there is a word to describe the most perfect perfection it would be Maxwell.  Oh and it doesn&apos;t hurt that he&apos;s already a MU fan!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3353" title="munce4" src="/media/munce4.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Check out those dimples.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3351" title="munce2" src="/media/munce2.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Oh and even babies get hang nails.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3355" title="munce6" src="/media/munce6.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I wish I could show you just how in love Amber is with Max.  It was obvious, and adorable, and she even spent some time convincing me that I need to have a baby so I can experience it too.  She told me she doesn&apos;t need much sleep so sometimes she lays awake watching him sleep.  Wow!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This big boy is definitely going to be an athlete like his daddy.  I doubt he&apos;ll even come close to fitting in this sack at 3 months.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3352" title="munce3" src="/media/munce3.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3354" title="munce5" src="/media/munce5.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And he loved to smile while he slept.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3356" title="munce7" src="/media/munce7.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3357" title="munce8" src="/media/munce8.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I think this last picture pretty much sums up the shoot.  This is Maxwell as we&apos;re cleaning up.  Seriously. LOVE!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3350" title="munce1" src="/media/munce1.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Steven, Amber, and Maxwell, I think you know how I feel about you!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
