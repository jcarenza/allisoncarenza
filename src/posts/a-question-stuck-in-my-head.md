<p>Last night my good friend Mike pointed out (in a nice way) that I wasn&#8217;t posting personal blogs anymore.  I texted right back with a, &#8220;haha that&#8217;s because I&#8217;m always shooting and editing&#8221;.  A quick response that kept me from looking at the ugly truth, I haven&#8217;t been blogging much, especially about me.  Most people wouldn&#8217;t give it much more thought, but unfortunately, for you, and the rest of the people reading this I have one of those nagging reflective brains that&#8217;s always asking why.  WHY am I avoiding writing the personal blogs?  So hours later in bed,  well 2 am, here are the thoughts my brain is insisting I write before bed.</p>
<p>1. Who really wants, or has time to read these random ramblings.  I mean, I don&#8217;t even use commas correctly, and, rarely, write in, complete, sentences.  It&#8217;s probably bad for your brain to read these blogs posts, and would be even worse if not for obnoxious spell check that&#8217;s always pointing out my inability to spell.</p>
<p>2. Do I really know myself well enough to share me?  As an artist, not so much.  But, as an ambitious 31 year old chick &#8230;perhaps.</p>
<p>3. Is it even professional to blog about my hectic, crazy, normal, life?  I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and blame this insecurity on my past teaching career.  They make you paranoid about everything!  Oh and besides I regularly (like every time we&#8217;re out and there&#8217;s a band) get on stage and try to sing/dance with the band in front of hundreds of people, some of which might act like they don&#8217;t know me.  I&#8217;ve literally forced myself on stages all over the world.  And besides that, aren&#8217;t politicians suppose to be professional.</p>
<p>4.How will this change what my clients think of me? Well I&#8217;m pretty sure most of them are so busy with kids, they don&#8217;t read this.  And I have really cool clients anyway.  And if they can&#8217;t hang, then can&#8217;t hang.  Period!</p>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s it, it&#8217;s time I start being my authentic self, no more excuses.  If I&#8217;m going to figure myself out as an artist and find my vision and develop a kick ass style I&#8217;m going to have to put myself out there.  I&#8217;m so having a Gerry Maguire moment while I type this.  Luckily no one can fire me in the morning.  Oh and the commas&#8230;deal with it.  Jon says I use too many, or too few.  If you&#8217;ve made it this far you probably don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>Because being authentic means being real I went out and tried to find a real picture of me doing what I do.  And I kinda look cool too!</p>
