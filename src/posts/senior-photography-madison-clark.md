<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Madison. Â College bound and ready to end her high school career and move towards becoming a doctor. Â She&apos;s athletic, smart and beautiful. Â I immediately liked Madison for her dynamic personality and huge smile. Â We clicked, and I had a blast spending the early evening as the sun was setting taking pictures of her being Madison.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Madison is all smiles, but every once and awhile she would turn and give me something right out of a magazine! Â Gah Madison you are so gorgeous! Â Are you sure you want to be a doctor, you could definitely do well as a model or actress. Â Just kidding. ðŸ™‚</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Words can&apos;t describe how much I love these senior pictures. Â I loved taking them, and I loved working on them, and I loved sharing them with you. Â Have a beautiful weekend!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And Madison, go out and change the world...I know you will!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
