<p style="text-align: center;">It was just a little over a year ago when Cara and Ian decided to tie the knot in beautiful Mexico.  They didn&apos;t wait long before getting pregnant, and now Harper is here, and the happiness just keeps growing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4165" title="cara3" src="/media/cara3.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">9 months of worry, stress, anxiety, and planning...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4164" title="cara2" src="/media/cara2.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But the whole time the two of them stayed close, friends, and supportive.  When Cara was freaking out, Ian was solid, and vice versa.  Most of the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4163" title="cara1" src="/media/cara1.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4166" title="cara4" src="/media/cara4.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And then just a week before Harper was due they found out she was breech and C-section was planned and put on the books.  But then true to Harper style she flipped the switch and literally flipped around.  So it was back to the original plan.  Then 12 hours of labor and Harper refusing to come out forced this strong couple to change the plan again.  The C-section was smooth all worked out perfectly!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4167" title="cahill1" src="/media/cahill1.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4168" title="cahill4" src="/media/cahill4.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But then at their one week checkup it was discovered that Harper had a low temp.  She was also dehydrated, and had a low blood pressure so the new family was sent to Children&apos;s Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4169" title="cahill3" src="/media/cahill3.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">After a few days of tests it was decided Harper was in perfect health and the young family was headed home again, frazzled, tired, but stronger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4170" title="cahill2" src="/media/cahill2.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4171" title="cahill5" src="/media/cahill5.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Cara and Ian have already been through so many tests, with so many challenges, but their love has helped them make it all look easy.  I think Harper is one lucky little girl, and Cara and Ian are especially lucky.  I just feel so lucky to be a part of this amazing family!</p>
