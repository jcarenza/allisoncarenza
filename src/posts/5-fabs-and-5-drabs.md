<p><strong>Every now and then I open my eyes and realize all kind of craziness is happening around me.  I mean seriously fabulous things, and seriously drab things.  So I decided every now and then I should document these monumental moments in my life.  Ok mostly not monumental, but still important.  Somewhat important anyway.  Here are my 5 fabs for the week...</strong></p>
<p>*Went to lunch at Gingers on the square in Liberty.  Good food, and better company.  Thanks Jamie.</p>
<p>*Played 4 hours of tennis!</p>
<p>*Went to the Designer showhouse.  Favorite one in years!</p>
<p>*Discovered my new favorite snack.  A flat wrap with Mozzarella and salami microwave for a few secs.  Just a little party in my mouth.</p>
<p>And the fab of the week... drum roll xmas vacation style please...</p>
<p>*My dad washed my car for me!  Inside and out!!!  YAY!</p>
<p><strong>And sadly enough my 5 drabs...</strong></p>
<p>*Lost was a rerun.</p>
<p>*Layla woke up in the middle of the night and puked yellow stuff on the floor, what a treat.</p>
<p>*The people racing on I-70.  Scary.</p>
<p>*Hitting myself in the eye with my tennis raquet.  I&apos;ll only say this once if you ask or notice my bump I will tell you Jon threw his raquet and hit me.</p>
<p>*Got peed on in a shoot this weekend by a newborn.  I will say this one is funny.  The little guy peed 3 times during our shoot one of which was on me.  I do love my job!</p>
<p>Looking over this list I realize most of this happened this weekend. I am a busy girl, but I had a lot of fun doing what I do!  I hope everyone had a great weekend!  Lots of love!!!!!</p>
<p>Al</p>
<p>PS  If you&apos;re having Monday blues just think it could look like this outside!  Just a few short months ago it did!</p>
