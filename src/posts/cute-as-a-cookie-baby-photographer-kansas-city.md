<p style="text-align: center;">This little dude is so cute I could just eat him up. Â I wanted to wrap my arms around him, and hug him, and squeeze him, and keep him as my own forever and ever. Â Unfortunately, his mom kinda feels the same way. Â So yah, I&apos;m gonna have to make my own baby. Â But for now, I can just enjoy the adorableness of other people&apos;s kids. Â ðŸ™‚</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This little man might look familiar because this is his 3 shoot since he was born, and he just keeps getting cuter!</p>
