<p style="text-align: center;">Ever been to an Opera?  Me neither, but I think it would be cool.  That&apos;s why I&apos;m going to go this year to the Lyric theatre to watch Joanna perform.  Joanna contacted me to take some new headshots for her upcoming perfomance.  I&apos;m so happy for her.  I know how hard she&apos;s worked to get to this place.  People that follow their dreams warm my heart.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This is her beautiful daughter Kylee.  It&apos;s hard to believe she&apos;s gotten so big.  I remember when she was an itty bitty baby still just as beautiful as she is now.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This is Kylee&apos;s little sister and they couldn&apos;t be more different.  Kylee is quiet, reserved and easy going.  Her sister is wild, opinionated, and always smiling and ready for fun.  Both girls are super sweet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1229" title="jo5" src="/media/jo5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="1550"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Both girls are also so very very beautiful!  I had a lot of fun taking their pictures and already look forward to the next time.</p>
