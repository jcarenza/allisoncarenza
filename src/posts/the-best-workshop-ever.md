<p style="text-align: center;">It&apos;s been a little over a week since I got back from my workshop in Santa Fe. Â I always come home from the workshops with a sense of...well it&apos;s hard to put into words, but it&apos;s always good, and inspiring, and awesome, and refreshing. Â This year was no different. Â In fact, this year was the best! Â I&apos;m dying to tell you all about it because I&apos;m still oozing with the good feelings from the class.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The <a href="http://http://www.santafeworkshops.com/">Santa Fe workshops</a> offer a variety of classes, from landscape, to portraiture, to fine art, to photoshop. Â They&apos;re all great workshops, in part because they&apos;re in Santa Fe and everywhere you turn there&apos;s a great image waiting to be captured, but mostly because they bring the best photographers in the industry to teach the classes. Â I was drawn to Jeff Lipsky&apos;s class because of his work, it&apos;s beautiful, natural, and can mostly be summed up as sunshine. ðŸ™‚ Â Yet, not quite rainbows. Â Check it out here. Â <a href="http://jefflipsky.com/">Jeff Lipsky</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jeff believes in keeping it simple, he loves beautiful window light, Â he doesn&apos;t use a tripod so he can easily change it up, and he is easily inspired. Â I loved watching him work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I really connected with his style and it was much needed confirmation, but my favorite part of the workshop was hearing the stories. Â Stories of hard shoots, stories of awesome shoots, and stories of failures that still haunt him. Â He was real and humble and easy to relate to.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Below are a few of the images I captured while practicing his techniques. Â All natural light. Â ðŸ™‚</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Jeff. Â He was a cowboy the day we went to the old western town. Â An LA cowboy anyway.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">If you&apos;re a photographer, at any level, I would encourage you to save your pennies for a Santa Fe workshop. Â You&apos;ll learn a ton from your instructor, but maybe even more from the people in the class. Â There were 14 in our class and we all loved each other. Â I made friends I&apos;ll keep forever. Â It was the best group ever! Â I mean just look how cool we are. Â ðŸ™‚</p>
