<p style="text-align: center;">It&apos;s the jumping off part that&apos;s scary. Â You&apos;re standing on the edge with the lightness of possibility in front of you and the darkness of what you know to be true behind you. Â You know the darkness isn&apos;t the life you would choose given the choice, but jumping still seems harder. Â There is no safety net, no one comforting you or guaranteeing you&apos;ll be ok, and you know you&apos;ll fall. Â So do you jump?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is exactly how I felt when I decided to leave my comfortable teaching career to pursue my dream. Â As it turns out I didn&apos;t fall to my demis, instead every fall, stumble, or lost way, lead me to a greater understanding that I was indeed doing the right thing, and that I would be ok. Â Even as I write these words there is a little voice saying, no one wants to hear this, they&apos;ll just say dreams are for dreamers. Â I have to hush those voices EVERY DAY! Â So today I&apos;m going to write these words and push send in the hopes that someone will read this and think dreams do come true, and happiness is a choice.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Taking pictures makes me happy so today I snapped a few of the snow. Â  The weatherman says if feels like -15 so I didn&apos;t even leave my deck, but I can&apos;t post without pics. ðŸ™‚ Â Happy Tuesday everyone!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The puppies are only outside for about 30 seconds at a time. Â They made a path down the side of the fence where the snow is shallower. Â They walk about halfway down the fence where their path ends go to the bathroom and walk back along the path to the house. Â Spoiled.</p>
