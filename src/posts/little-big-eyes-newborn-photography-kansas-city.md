<p style="text-align: center;">Paxton...small, long, huge eyes, and wide awake!  But so content.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">New parents are easy to spot.  All tentative, and gentle, a little unsure, and in total awe.  That would pretty much sum up Tim and Jamie.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I could also tell they must make a pretty good team because they came into the studio well rested, just 2 weeks after baby Paxton was born.  Being a new parent must be so challenging, but having someone to help you must make it a whole lot easier.  When I asked Jamie if the nurses taught her a lot in the hospital, she was all, um no.  Then she laughed and told me her mom made fun of her when she changed Paxton&apos;s diaper for the first time with Tim...together.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This is the point in the shoow when I was like, little Paxton please close those big eyes so I can get a sleepy shot, and he was like, but look how cute I am.  Typically newborns are so fussy when I pose them awake, but not Paxton, I could do anything.  I think he&apos;s going to be laid back.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2896" title="pax4" src="/media/pax4.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="500"   />Tim and Jamie,  enjoy every moment with this little man.  He&apos;ll be grown up before you know it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thanks for letting me capture these.</p>
