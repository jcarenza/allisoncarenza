<p style="text-align: center;">This is Tyler and he&apos;s a graduated senior from Blue Hills High School. Â I got to spend some time with Tyler taking his senior pics and he is a an outstanding person.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947" title="tyler6" src="/media/tyler6.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="400"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He&apos;s very driven and determined. Â One of those kids that you know is going to do great things because of the fierce passion in their eyes. Â Tyler definitely is passionate in fact I think it&apos;s fair to say he has one love, and that&apos;s hockey!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He&apos;s played forever and traveled the country on teams. Â He is currently trying to get on a professional team. Â I love when people go for their passion. Â Go Tyler Go!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Hockey always seems like a scary sport to me. Â I expect all hockey players to be a little rough around the edges. Â Ya know missing a few teeth and stuff. Â Not Tyler he&apos;s got style and class. Â Check it out!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">And big hands! Â I guess you gotta have big hands to hold the hockey stick. Â Wait is that what it&apos;s called? Â Tyler also told me he likes the fights. Â I told him I do too, but only because they have lots of stuff on. Â So it&apos;s kinda like fighting in the sumo suits. Â And they always break &apos;em up pretty fast.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Tyler good luck in all you do! Â I say go for it! Â Keep me posted on your progress, and next time we do picks don&apos;t forget your hockey stick. Â ðŸ™‚</p>
