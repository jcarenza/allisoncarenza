<p style="text-align: center;">They met in college at K-state, back when they were wild college kids.  I think they are still kinda wild, and I know they are always busy which is why they probably didn&apos;t have time to tell the world they were expecting.  So when I posted the pics on facebook their loving friends went wild with excitement.  They are so very loved, and I can see why!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Even though Jonas was sick with chills, but he didn&apos;t show it.  He wins the hubby of the year award for sure!</p>
