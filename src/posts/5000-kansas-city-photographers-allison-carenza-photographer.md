<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I had lunch with a gal today who is a photographer and made the mistake of asking her if she knew you. She said there are like 5000 photographers in KC...:) &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This was in a message from one of my friends.  She went on to talk about tennis and what not, but her first words struck me, and I wasn&apos;t so sure why so I had to go back and reread them again.  It made me wonder  how I respond when someone asks me if I know so and so photographer.  I always listen, and if I haven&apos;t heard of them, I say no I haven&apos;t heard of them, where are they from, I&apos;ll have to look them up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">There may very well be 5000 photographers in Kansas City.  Although I&apos;ve never looked for that information.  I can also assume there are probably 5000 doctors, 5000 lawyers,  5000 teachers, and 5000 business men and women.  Maybe even 5000 plumbers, 5000 real estate agents, 5000 financial planners.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Each of which has a special gift.  Maybe it&apos;s their talent in the field they have chosen, maybe it&apos;s the dedication to their clients, maybe it&apos;s the way they make their work environment a better place, but all of them offer something different.  Which sets them apart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">All photographers offer something different too.  I have a special bond with my clients.  I make them feel like family.  I know it&apos;s my gift.  I choose to focus on that rather than the awesome KC photogs that some would consider my competition.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">5000 is just a number.  Scarcity is just a word.  Believing in yourself is a feeling.  A feeling that is real.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I hope these pics make you smile the way they made me smile.</p>
