<div style="text-align: center;">I love taking pictures of bellies!  I think women that are pregnant are magical.  Below are pictures of Jenny and her man Steve!</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">Jenny is so excited to be a mom, but she was hesitant about having her maternity pictures taken.  It was actually Steve that convinced her.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Steve called me to book the appointment, and made me feel like a million bucks.  He went on and on about how artistic my photos are.  It made me feel amazing.  It&apos;s not often the hubbys and boyfriends notice the artistic photos.  Thanks Steve, you made my day!</div>
