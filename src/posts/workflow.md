<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;m kinda a right brain person.  I go with the flow.  I throw things together at the last minute.  I use kitchen utensils for repairing the car when we don&apos;t have the right tool.  Ok I&apos;ve never repaired the car, but you get the point.  I just like to think outside the box.  Scratch that, I like to live outside the box.  Which is why I probably love my job so much.  Having said that, there is a big part of a photography business that is so not right brain friendly.  The books, the taxes, the workflow.  Out of those 3, workflow is the least miserable, so I&apos;ll start there.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am random, but I like to work fast, and be efficient.  This is probably not the best, but right now it&apos;s the best for me.  My pics go from camera to client in about a week to 2 weeks.  Today I&apos;ll just cover the computer part.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Step 1:  I take the pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Step 2:  I download the pics to my computer in<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/bridge.html"> adobe bridge</a>.  I have an AC2011 file that has each month in it.  I&apos;m supposed to burn a CD each month at the end of the month and delete it from my computer, but yah I&apos;m way behind.  In the month file, I have each shoot labeled with a date and family name.  So a shoot done today would be labeled like this.   AC2011/April/4-28-11 Moore</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Step 3:  Once they are on the computer I import them into Lightroom where I process the RAW files.  Once I&apos;m done I export  them back to the same file under edited.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">AC2011/April/4-28-11 Moore/edited</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Step 4:  I back up those edited files on my external hard drive which is set up in a similar way.  I then delete the RAW files.  Notice I have not cleared my card until they are backed up in a second place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Step 5:  I do a quick run through the images in Bridge to see if any need <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?sdid=FIGGA&amp;skwcid=TC|22182|CS4%20photoshop||S|b|7503287058">photoshopping</a>.  This step can add a lot of time if the images need a lot of work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Step 6:  I upload a small preview to facebook and then the rest to my site for the clients to view.  Sometimes I do a blog, and sometimes I don&apos;t have time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Step 7:  I email the clients the link and yay I&apos;m done!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">7 steps that take about 2 hours give or take from start to finish.  Slower sometimes because I daydream.  Being right brained can be so frustrating.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I hope some other random right brained peeps out there find this useful, please share with your photog friends.  If you have any questions don&apos;t hesitate to post them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Much Love and Happy Shooting my friends!</p>
