<p style="text-align: center;">Remember the Bat Mitzvah pics I mentioned?  Well before the big event took place Melanie came in and had her pictures taken for her red carpet themed party.  She has one of the most upbeat personalities and a smile that will light up a room!  The pictures tell it all!  Enjoy!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I so enjoyed working with Melanie and her parents, Mary and George.  I had a blast watching them have fun.  I have so much more to show and share when I post the pics from the event.  I just got done processing them today.  Can&apos;t wait to share!</p>
