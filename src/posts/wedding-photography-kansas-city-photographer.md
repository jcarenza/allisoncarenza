<p style="text-align: center;">Their love is solid, strong, and capable of dealing with anything.  And on this day, their day, it was all about them.  While Allison is quiet, a little shy, and drop dead gorgeous.  Matt is the talker, a real funny guy, and happy to make others laugh.  Together, they are a team.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3014" title="w1" src="/media/w11.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">As I positioned Matt for the first look his shaky hands made a few last unnecessary adjustments to his tie.  One of my most favorite things about shooting a wedding is watching the bride and groom see each other for the first time.  The first look is priceless, as are the moments just before.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3015" title="w2" src="/media/w21.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Allison was able to see Matt before he could see her, and she was even more nervous than him.  Excited nervous.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3016" title="w3" src="/media/w31.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then it was all giddy time!  Matt always has Allison smiling.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3017" title="w4" src="/media/w41.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sigh...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3018" title="w5" src="/media/w51.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="500"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes I make couples do silly things like stand in broken elevators.  Haha</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3019" title="w6" src="/media/w61.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The wedding and reception were at <a href="http://blackonburlington.com/default.aspx">Black on Burlington</a> in North Kansas City.  The room with the bar was amazing with this tall contraption going up several floors.  I love old building made into something cool!  This building is called the Cable building.  I think it has something to do with oats, but I&apos;m not sure, my listening skills weren&apos;t working that well with photography on the brain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3021" title="w8" src="/media/w8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3022" title="w9" src="/media/w9.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Allison you are perfection, and that dress was made for you!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3023" title="w10" src="/media/w101.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3025" title="w12" src="/media/w12.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">After the ceremony we tooled around downtown North Kansas City where I had scoped out some sweet light.  Of course I was jammin&apos; my music, so it was pretty much a party of pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3026" title="w13" src="/media/w13.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The pic on the right is so GQ!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3027" title="w14" src="/media/w14.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Oh wholly mother of light!  I love the way it&apos;s wrapping around behind them and filling up the front.  I&apos;m pretty sure finding light is my mission in life!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3028" title="w15" src="/media/w15.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3029" title="w16" src="/media/w16.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">They were doing this kinda cute stuff all day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3030" title="w17" src="/media/w17.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3031" title="w18" src="/media/w18.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3032" title="w19" src="/media/w19.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We didn&apos;t get in trouble as the sign might indicate, but just around the corner we could hear a domestic argument going down.  You just never know what you&apos;re going to get when you&apos;re out taking pics.  I was quick to tell Allison and Matt that they would never fight like that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3033" title="w20" src="/media/w20.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499"   /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Allison is an awesome baker, and she loves cupcakes.  So of course she had to have a cupcake wedding cake thanks to Babycakes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3035" title="w22" src="/media/w22.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It started raining that evening.  I gave mother nature another shout out, but not before going on the roof for this one last shot.  With KC in the background I think it&apos;s the perfect ending to this perfect day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3036" title="w23" src="/media/w23.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="499"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Three words to sum up this day...gorgeous, fun, and adorable love!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Allison and Matt I love that I got to be your photog.   I hope you had a blast on your honeymoon in Mexico.   Now get to work on makin&apos; some babies for me to photograph!  Just kidding take your time, but really I&apos;m already looking forward to it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
