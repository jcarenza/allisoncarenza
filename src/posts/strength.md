<p>A year ago today Lauren&#8217;s love went out hunting like he did a million times before.  It was an especially cold day, and Lauren was reluctant to let him go, but Adam loved duck hunting so much even a nasty winter day couldn&#8217;t keep him from the lake.  They kissed goodbye, and Adam gave his two young boys a goodbye hug.  Lauren told me she remembers those last moments together as a family, she remembers how they felt perfect, and full of love.</p>

<p>Adam didn&#8217;t make it home that night, he left behind his loves, but his legacy will live on in these three remarkable people.</p>

<p>Lauren was my first nurse in the hospital after having Kellen.  We hit if off immediately, and stayed in touch after I left the hospital,  so when she posted on facebook that her husband was missing of course I wanted to help in any way I could.</p>

Over the course of a year I have watched Lauren suffer with every emotion imaginable.  I can&#8217;t understand what she&#8217;s gone through, what it must be like to lose your husband, your best friend, and the father of your children, but I have watched Lauren go through it, and I&#8217;ve watched her come out on the other side. Lauren&#8217;s strength, her vulnerability, her willingness to now reach out and help other women suffering the same hell she went through is nothing short of a miracle.  I adore this woman, and consider her an inspiration.  This shoot was a thank you gift.  We need more Lauren&#8217;s in the world.  Her boys Miles and James suffered a tragic loss as well, but they are going to be just fine because their mom is one bad ass lady!</p>

<p>I love you Lauren, and I&#8217;m lucky to know you.  My heart aches for you today.</p>
<p>I send you and the boys all my love.</p>
