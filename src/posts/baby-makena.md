<p style="text-align: center;">Sweet Sweet Makena.  Just 12 days old and she already has eyelashes to die for, and more hair than a typical 3 month old.  I loved my time working with this little.  Not just because she was super cuddly, and I think she liked me, but because I think her parents are pretty awesome too!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes when I&apos;m taking a families very first family portrait I get misty eyed.  No lie!</p>
