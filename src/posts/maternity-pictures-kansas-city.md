<p style="text-align: center;">This is Buddy and Tara, and they are as in love as them seem to be in these pics.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;ve know these two cool cats since college.  They went to William Woods University too.  They were both jocks in school, Tara played softball, and Buddy was a volleyball player.  He was also in the same fraternity as Jon, and they were good buddies.  The cool thing about Buddy and Tara is that they haven&apos;t changed.  They are both the same fun-loving, outgoing people they were in school.  I will admit seeing Tara with a belly was a bit freaky.  It&apos;s always weird when your friends get pregnant for the first time.  It&apos;s hard to imagine them as a momma, but Tara will be perfect.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">When I shared the pics with Tara she was absolutely glowing with pride and excitement.  We talked about what it will be like in those first few moments when she becomes a mom and looks down at her little creation.  She told me that she saw a new newborn recently and just wanted to hold it so bad.  I took that as a sign of someone as ready as they&apos;ll ever be.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;m happy to report that baby Adalynn Kay Smith has arrived and is doing so well!  Tara and Buddy are parents now, and they are doing a fabulous job!</p>
