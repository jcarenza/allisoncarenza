<p style="text-align: center;">Every time I photograph a senior in high school I&apos;m reminded of my awkward senior pics.  Since I&apos;ve been photographing so many senior lately I really need to get a copy of some of those pics and post them on the blog.  Not only because it would give my friends a good laugh, but also to illustrate the stark contrast.  In both photography and maturity.  Granted, I was a particularly gangly late bloomer, but still the photography was so blah!  That&apos;s why I work extra hard at my job to make these young ladies look and feel fabulous!  Although, sometimes it&apos;s a very easy job.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Haley, a beautiful girl, a middle distance track star, a big MU fan, mostly because her boyfriend plays football there, and a senior in high school ready to go to college and learn and grow so she can someday change the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We spent an evening last week tooling around the city.  She made me laugh, she inspired me, and she gave me her very best!  I loved my time with Haley and her mom LaTasha.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Oh Haley, my senior pictures were so far from beautiful like this, like you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Fierce!  She was such a natural.  And I love the polish!  My favorite color right now!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Gorgeous and timeless.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Haley has such strength and innocence.  I can see she is going to do such great things in life!</p>
