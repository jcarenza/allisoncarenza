<p style="text-align: center;">6 months and growing.  Little Harper just keeps getting bigger and bigger!  It seems like just yesterday she was coming in for her newborn pics, and now she&apos;s sitting and interacting like a big girl.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The beginning of the shoot she was slow to warm, but once I got the tickler (aka duster) out, it was over.  I even had a whole conversation with Harper about the tickler, she absolutely loved it.  I need to patent my annoying, high pitch method for using the tickler.  Tickle Tickle Tickle!  It wasn&apos;t long before Harper was mimicking my antics.  What wonderful memory!  Not to mention I love her momma Laura!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
