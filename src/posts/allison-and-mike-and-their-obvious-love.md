<p style="text-align: center;">I started to type and retype this blog a couple times, because really it&apos;s hard to sum up the love Mike and Allison have for each other. Â I mean most of the day of their wedding, they didn&apos;t even notice me because they were so lost in each other. Â Let me back up. Â Allison is a horse girl just like myself, so I insisted she and Mike, and Jon and I, go have dinner to talk wedding stuff because really I just knew we would click, and we did like we&apos;d been friends forever. Â We met at Westside Local for dinner, it was the first time I&apos;d met Mike, and my first impression was that he&apos;s one of those guys you could call if you did something really bad and needed help. Â The kind of friend that doesn&apos;t judge, so yah, I liked him a lot. Â But even more obvious was his adoration for Allison. Â Anytime he looked at her he had those goofy madly in love eyes that melt Allison. Â I loved it! Â And Allison was just as smittin. Â Giddy about the wedding, and their future together. Â They made it clear that whatever happened in their life they would have each other and that&apos;s all that really mattered. Â It&apos;s like Allison and Mike love each other for exactly who they are.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The wedding and reception were held in downtown Lees Summit at <a href="http://www.thestanleyeventspace.com/homepage/launch">The Stanley</a>. Â The owner and coordinators are awesome!</p>
