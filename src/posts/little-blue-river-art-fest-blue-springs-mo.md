<p>Walls- check</p>
<p>Art work- check</p>
<p>Lighting- check</p>
<p>Marketing materials- check</p>
<p>People- ???? Â I hope ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>The Little Blue Art Fest is only 3 days away and I&apos;m beside myself with excitement. Â I remember years ago walking down the many rows of the Plaza Art Fair and thinking to myself I wanna do this. Â Never in a million years did I think I was actually gonna do this. Â Obviously this isn&apos;t the Plaza Art Fair, but it&apos;s a start. I was actually thinking just yesterday that following your dreams is a lot like walking the plank. Â I&apos;m consumed with fear, but if I don&apos;t look down I won&apos;t fall down. Â That pretty much describes the events leading up to this. Â I just kept looking up, moving forward, and hoping for the best. Â Last night Jon and I sat on the couch and admired our booth. Â Both just staring, a little bit in awe. Â I spend a lot of time dreaming of making my dreams come true, but now that one has, it&apos;s pretty euphoric.</p>
<p>Now that the work is done I can relax and have fun. Â The festival is this Saturday on the corner of 7hwy and 40hwy (White Oak Plaza) from 10-6. Â There will be kids activities, music, food, and of course art. Â If you&apos;re a client of mine I also have a little surprise for you when you stop by and say hi. Â Who knows your picture might be on display.</p>
<p>Well, back to work. Â I hope to see you Saturday!</p>
<p>xoxo</p>
