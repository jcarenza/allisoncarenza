<p style="text-align: center;">Little baby Amelia graced my studio on Thursday.  She was bright eyed and bushy tailed for the first 45 minutes of our session, but my soothing ways and warm blankets finally won her sleepy eyes over.  I had a great time getting to know grandma, and parents Trent and Emilee, and I especially loved getting to know Amelia, with those perfect chubby cheeks, and puffy lips that she like to let fall open when she is super sleepy.  Oh Amelia, she are perfection!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">A rare and special moment, but Amelia was soooo strong, and insisted on looking around.</p>
