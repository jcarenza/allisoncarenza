<p style="text-align: center;">This is Ryan and he is not your typical teenager.  What is a typical teenager anyway?  Would it be the high school cheerleader type, the jock, the computer geek?  I think the point I&apos;m trying to make is that there is no such thing as a typical teenager.  It&apos;s the nature of the beast.  Teens are flooded with influences, and feelings of uncertainty.  That&apos;s why I like them.  They&apos;ve got all the confidence to achieve everything and anything. Ryan is no different.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Ryan&apos;s mom found me on the internet and liked my style because she said it was different.  I love that!  She knew Ryan wasn&apos;t a big fan of having his pictures taken and knew it would take edgy photos to get him to cooperate.  Edgy is just what we went for, and Ryan totally cooperated, minus the smiles.  Despite my greatest efforts Ryan wouldn&apos;t give me more than a smirk.  I even popped out from behind my camera and said boo.  It&apos;s ok though I think portraits are at their greatest when they are real.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Here&apos;s the smirk!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Ryan thanks for letting me capture you in this important phase of your life.  I wish you the biggest and brightest future!</p>
