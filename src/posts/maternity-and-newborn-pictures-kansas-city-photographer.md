<p style="text-align: center;">It was her laugh that I noticed first.  During our shoot Tish just had a way of making me smile when she laughed.  Not because it was big, or obnoxious, or silly, but it was real, and I could tell.  That&apos;s what I noticed first, then I noticed how Jermaine always noticed.  He smiled too.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Maybe the glowing came from the  fact that this pregnancy was a true blessing for them, or, maybe they just glow when they&apos;re together.  They tried for a long time before realizing they needed help.  This story is unfortunately all too common in my studio, but I love all the success stories I get to witness.  In those precious moments when clients expose their hearts and hardships to me I am humbled.  But to Jermaine it&apos;s just a miracle to get pregnant at all.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Then came baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A BIG BABY!!!!!  So big in fact Tish had to have a c-section.   Beautiful, perfect  Malachi was born into the arms of two very excited and very loving parents.  Just a few days later I got to meet him.  For an hour and a half we admired the ahh of a newborn baby.  It never really gets old.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Malachi was special because he would do these little smiles the whole time.  And he&apos;s strong!  He was holding his head up like crazy.  It was great.  I have a feeling he&apos;ll be walking way sooner than he should.</p>
