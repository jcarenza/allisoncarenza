<p style="text-align: center;">Meet little Aiden, he is one lucky little dude because his mom Angie, and dad Andy, love him to pieces.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3437" title="deg6" src="/media/deg6.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Angie was referred to me through a friend Amy, and I&apos;m so glad she did. Â We laughed, joked, andÂ gaggedÂ over baby Aiden. Â I should rephrase that, Andy joked, and joked, and joked. Â So much fun. Â In case you haven&apos;t noticed, this post will only use A names.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3436" title="deg5" src="/media/deg5.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I think Aiden enjoyed his photo shoot!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3434" title="deg3" src="/media/deg3.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Andy told me he and his dad went to every Bears game growing up. Â He wants to continue the tradition with his own boy. Â Da Bears. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3433" title="deg2" src="/media/deg2.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Every time I take the first family photo my heart melts a little. Â It&apos;s the first of many, but it&apos;s the first and that makes it special. Â I&apos;m humbled to be the one to take it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3432" title="deg1" src="/media/deg1.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;m pretty sure he was thinking words here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3435" title="deg4" src="/media/deg4.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Aiden, Andy, and Angie, you guys are adorable. Â Stay cute 4ever!</p>
