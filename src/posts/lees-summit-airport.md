<p style="text-align: center;">If you&apos;ve been with me for awhile you might recognize this little family.  I&apos;ve been photographing the Parish family for years, and every time we capture beautiful pictures of genuine love.  Now that Autumn is bigger her sassy silly side is starting to show, and I think it&apos;s awesome.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Greg recently got his pilot certification so when I suggested we do their shoot at the Lees Summit airport they were all over it.  I think it was the first time Greg was excited for the photo shoot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It was a gorgeous summer day in the middle of the day, which makes light tricky for me, but we managed to use the planes and big walls as bounce light to capture some amazing moments.</p>
