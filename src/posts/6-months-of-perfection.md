<p style="text-align: center;">I get it now.  I didn&apos;t before, but now I get it., how you can totally lose yourself in the love for your child.  I admit I judged women that lost their identity when they became a mother, but now that I&apos;m a mother of a beautiful boy, I get it.  I think these pictures of baby Tristan and momma Rachel best show the lost love that mommas feel for their littles.</p>
