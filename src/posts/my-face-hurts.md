<p style="text-align: center;">I love this family.  They&apos;ve been with me for a couple years now and every shoot just keeps getting better and better.  I cherish my clients, hold them close to my heart, and value the responsibility they give me to capture these very important moments!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Sims are one of those families.  I look forward to our shoots, I grow closer to them and their kids every year, and I can&apos;t wait for the next one.  After our photo shoots my face hurts from smiling and laughing so much.  I think these photos will best express why and how.  And these are just a few of the random ones I picked out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">These two remind me of my brother and I.  They are so close and I&apos;m sure always will be.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Oh this one is hilarious.  Not sure what I said, but it evoked this priceless moment!</p>
