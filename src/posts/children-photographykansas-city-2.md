<p style="text-align: center;">Adorable....nuff said!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1140" title="glas1" src="/media/glas1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="/media/glas1.jpg 600w, /media/glas1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is Annie, and she is just about as perfect as perfect can be.  As you can see she&apos;s super photogenic, but what you can&apos;t see is that she is so patient, understanding, and willing to do everything her mom Melissa and I asked.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1144" title="glas5" src="/media/glas5.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" srcset="/media/glas5.jpg 400w, /media/glas5-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She is also super good with her little brother Sam.  Sam is quiet and patient too, but he wasn&apos;t last time we took pics.  Last time he was scared, this time he was perfect just like his sister.  I mean it was really too easy.  Picking pics to share with you was a real challenge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1143" title="glas4" src="/media/glas4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="/media/glas4.jpg 600w, /media/glas4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And then Sam gave me this little jewel.  He&apos;s a serious little boy by nature, but he also loves to laugh.  I was just changing up my lights and he just stood waiting.  I feel like I can see right into his soul in this picture.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1142" title="glas3" src="/media/glas3.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" srcset="/media/glas3.jpg 400w, /media/glas3-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I said Annie is good with her brother, but I didn&apos;t tell you that Sam loves his sister!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1145" title="glas6" src="/media/glas6.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="/media/glas6.jpg 600w, /media/glas6-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">See what I mean...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1141" title="glas2" src="/media/glas2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" srcset="/media/glas2.jpg 400w, /media/glas2-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />Melissa I always love our time together!  I hope Ben loved his father&apos;s day gift as much as I liked taking them!</p>
