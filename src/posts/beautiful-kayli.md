<p style="text-align: center;">I would define my style as Colorado meets the beach, jeans, hoodies, flip flops, sun dresses, pretty much anything comfortable.  Always comfort first.  Accessories what?  I&apos;ve never made the effort to match my bag to my outfit.  I buy a bag and use it until it gets worn out or I get sick of it.  I just don&apos;t have an eye for fashion.  I try, but bless my heart, looking fashionable is just not in the cards for me.  However, this is not the case for Kayli, a fashionista if I&apos;ve ever met one, she is thrifty, and creative, great at throwing this and that together to make the cutest outfits, yellow belt here, chunky earrings there.  I&apos;m jealous, but she is gorgeous.  And not because she&apos;s got some great style.  Kayli is one of the sweetest girls I know, and we share a bday which makes us sisters...kinda.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Kayli is one of those people that doesn&apos;t know she&apos;s beautiful, which makes her super humble, and kind.  But really she&apos;s gorgeous!  Let me hear it..UH HUH!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">From fierce to fun! LOVE!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4846" alt="k2" src="/media/k21.jpg" width="930" height="680"   /> Kayli, I have loved working at the boutique with you and getting to know you more.  You have big things in your future.  Remember to do what you love!  Someday I&apos;ll totally hire you to shop for me!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
