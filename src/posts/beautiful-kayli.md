<p style="text-align: center;">I would define my style as Colorado meets the beach, jeans, hoodies, flip flops, sun dresses, pretty much anything comfortable.  Always comfort first.  Accessories what?  I&#8217;ve never made the effort to match my bag to my outfit.  I buy a bag and use it until it gets worn out or I get sick of it.  I just don&#8217;t have an eye for fashion.  I try, but bless my heart, looking fashionable is just not in the cards for me.  However, this is not the case for Kayli, a fashionista if I&#8217;ve ever met one, she is thrifty, and creative, great at throwing this and that together to make the cutest outfits, yellow belt here, chunky earrings there.  I&#8217;m jealous, but she is gorgeous.  And not because she&#8217;s got some great style.  Kayli is one of the sweetest girls I know, and we share a bday which makes us sisters&#8230;kinda.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Kayli is one of those people that doesn&#8217;t know she&#8217;s beautiful, which makes her super humble, and kind.  But really she&#8217;s gorgeous!  Let me hear it..UH HUH!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">From fierce to fun! LOVE!</p>
