<p>My dogs have found their joy.  It comes in the form of little brown pellets that smell nasty, but apparently taste delicious to them.   Every day from 2-4 anytime I get up to do anything they are at my feet, hoping it&apos;s time to get a little bit of their joy.  Lucy spins wreckless circles, and Layla jumps up and down repeatedly on her hind legs. It&apos;s annoying to me, and most days I look at them and say &#8220;not yet&#8221;!  But sometimes, I just laugh. When it is finally dinner time they gobble up the food in seconds, go outside, come back in, and lick the bowls, just in case.</p>
<p>Watching them every day gets me thinking about joy, and how easy it is to have it taken away, and how hard it can be to find.  I recently let someone steal my joy, but just for a little second.  I felt bad, and even worse, bad about myself.  Like I had failed.  It was all in my head of course, but for that half day my joy was gone.  So, I did some reflecting, some yoga, and then decided that in 5 years I wouldn&apos;t even remember this situation.  If only it was as easy as pouring some brown pellets in a bowl.  I was indeed able to reclaim my joy fairly fast, but it was all on me, and for some I know it&apos;s not that easy.  Right now, during this  crazy holiday season joy is all around us.  I love the family time, the parties with friends, the decorations, the food, but when all that&apos;s gone and the deep gray winter sky settles in, it&apos;s easy to lose sight of what&apos;s important... my joy!</p>
<p>So, to help me remember here is a little list.</p>
<p>Jon, puppies, family, friends, PHOTOGRAPHY, my work, wait is that the same?, Diamond horse, a clean house, travel, reading, eating, I love food, making new friends, learning about a new culture, helping someone in need</p>
<p>That&apos;s a pretty good list, I&apos;m pretty sure there are lots of other things, I&apos;ll just have to add as I go.  I have a lot to be thankful for, and when I look at this list there is no reason I should ever let someone take my joy!  I hope you do the same.</p>
<p>xoxo</p>
