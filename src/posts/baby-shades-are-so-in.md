<p style="text-align: center;">There&apos;s a reason I love taking pictures of 6 month olds.  Ok there are many reasons.  First of all 6 month old babies usually can&apos;t crawl yet, but they are sitting up which offers up way more options from a posing perspective, also they kinda have an idea of what&apos;s going on, but mostly I love photographing this age because they are developing a personality.  Shaelee is no different.  She&apos;s all smiles and happy, except when she&apos;s not, but even then she&apos;s still beautiful perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Oh and I didn&apos;t mention the fat rolls.  I love fat rolls on my babies!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Oh stop Shaelee you are too perfect!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4734" alt="shar2" src="/media/shar2.jpg" width="930" height="680"   /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And then I died and went to baby photographer heaven.  Seriously.  On the spot, when she looked at me across the glasses on her nose!  SERIOUSLY!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Momma Sharlene is totally aware of her babies cuteness.  I&apos;m happy to be the one to have captured this real moment!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4736" alt="shar4" src="/media/shar4.jpg" width="930" height="680"   />Oh how I love my job.  And Sharlene and Shaelee!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xoxo</p>
