<p>It&apos;s so easy when you&apos;re a kid to say that ya wanna do this, ya wanna do that, ya wanna change the world. Â  But something happens as we get older. Â I think the world handicaps us with the agreements we start to make. Â We start to think that only the beautiful, intelligent, super talented, and &#8220;special&#8221; people do those things the rest of us dream about. Â I am just as guilty as the majority of the world, and every day I still battle those nasty agreements. Â I call it head trash, but it really just boils down to excuses that keep me from feeling the guilt that follows failure. Â I don&apos;t know how far I&apos;ve come, but I know every day I wake up and try to do something that brings me closer to my ultimate goals. Â Slowly the little goals build until I am accomplishing a big goal. Â My first art gallery opening is my second big goal! Â Someday I hope it&apos;s just one of those little goals, but for now, today, it&apos;s big. Â Â With this accomplishment comes more fear and head trash to boggle my mind. Â Getting the gallery, and artwork together was easy. Â Now I have to worry about how to get people to come, how much wine to buy, Â what to wear, and how to be &#8220;that girl&#8221; you know the artist. Â That last one makes me sweat. Â Knowing I&apos;ll be surrounded by my incredible, supportive friends eases the anxiety, but I&apos;m still pretty sure I won&apos;t sleep Thursday the 5th. Â ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>I hope you can come out and enjoy the crazy festivities that we call &#8220;First Fridays&#8221; here in KC. Â My signature pieces will be for sale, but I&apos;ll also have smaller 8&#215;10 and 5&#215;7 prints for sale as well. Â  Â The gallery is just a few doors down form Lulu&apos;s noodle house, I&apos;ll have a sign out front. Â Come by and say hi, Â get a glass of wine, and maybe even find something that will look good on your wall. Â Oh, and please invite your friends, remember that little bit of head trash I mentioned a second ago.</p>
<p>I can&apos;t wait to see you Friday the 6th. Â ðŸ™‚</p>
