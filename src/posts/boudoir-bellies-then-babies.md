<p style="text-align: center;">I think bellies, babies and boudoir just sounds better so that&apos;s why I have it in that order on my website, but really, it should go boudoir, bellies, then babies. Â That&apos;s the order Erin chose to get her pics taken.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&apos;ll leave the boudoir photos for Greg, but I would like to share a little bit about the belly and baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It started a few years back when Jon handed me gift certificates for free massages, I was a little more than stoked. Â But that&apos;s before I even met Erin and learned that she&apos;s a passionate business <a href="http://www.caringtouchmassage.biz/">owner</a>, always looking to better herself and her business. Â She was working at the NAIC with Jon at the time, but wan&apos;t happy. Â Her heart was in massage. Â So when she decided to jump ship, and go out on her own, I was in awe and oh so inspired! Â We would spend our time together talking about how it felt to be self- employed, sharing ideas for what&apos;s working, and what&apos;s not. Â Always with a smile, she would quietly encourage me to &#8220;just do it&#8221;. Â She&apos;s an outstanding massage therapist, but an even better friend. Â She really inspired, and pushed me to go for my dreams. Â She made it seem doable. Â I noticed her whole person changing when she went full time into massage therapy, and dreamt of the day I would have that glow.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We didn&apos;t always talk about business, sometimes we talked about babies. Â We shared a fear of motherhood. Â Both of us worried we just weren&apos;t going to be good enough. Â Erin again jumped ship. Â And again I am so proud. Â Maybe not as inspired just yet, but definitely happy for her.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Her pregnancy was a nasty one. Â She was sick for her first 2 trimesters. Â She actually lost weight getting pregnant!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2164" title="erin3" src="/media/erin3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500"  /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She was still glowing but for a whole different reason. Â Baby! Â Oh and I didn&apos;t mention that she&apos;s kinda obsessed with Greg her husband. Â I swear I&apos;ve seen her staring at him countless times with a smile that looks a lot like a school girl with a crush.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2162" title="erin1" src="/media/erin1.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then baby Autumn arrived! Â Unlike the pregnancy the delivery was a smooth one. Â Just 15 minutes of pushing. Â All the mommas out there that pushed for 2 hours are now allowed to groan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2156" title="aut2" src="/media/aut2.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Oh course I was dying to hear everything! Â Erin made it seem way to easy. Â And she said it was because she had so much love for Autumn.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But honestly if I&apos;m going to give credit to someone it&apos;s Greg. Â He was like the baby whisperer! Â Seriously impressive!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2160" title="aut6" src="/media/aut6.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Newborns don&apos;t giggle and laugh but this kinda looks like she is. Â Love it!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2159" title="aut5" src="/media/aut5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="499" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Happy Easter everyone!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2161" title="aut7" src="/media/aut7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="500" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thank you so much for letting me take pictures of your little Autumn. Â I look forward to watching her grow into a big girl! Â And I look forward to Erin getting back to work. Â I need a <a href="http://www.caringtouchmassage.biz/">massage</a>! Â ðŸ™‚</p>
