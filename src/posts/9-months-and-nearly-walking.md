<p style="text-align: center;">Meet Mr. Brogan.  This is Brogan&apos;s 4th shoot, well, 5th if you count the time he was still in momma Carrie.  I can&apos;t believe how much he&apos;s changed in just a short amount of time!  What a little slice of perfection.  Every shoot he has shown a little different side of personality, curious, happy, lovable!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">What a sweet moment.  And did you notice those hands.  Brogan has big hands, I think he&apos;s going to grow up to be a big boy!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4763" alt="Kramer2" src="/media/Kramer2.jpg" width="930" height="680" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4764" alt="kramer3" src="/media/kramer3.jpg" width="930" height="680"   /> Oh Brogan you melt my little heart.  I can&apos;t wait to see you in just a few months when you will be 1 year old!</p>
