<p style="text-align: center;">I met Rebecca while watching Jon and her hubby Mike play volleyball for corporate challenge.  We hit it off and made plans to do lunch with the boys downtown someday.  Well someday never came, but a couple years later Rebecca contacted me ready to get together...for maternity pictures!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I was more than excited because I knew they had been trying since I saw her at the volleyball game.  Like so many other couples I get to know, getting pregnant was not as easy as expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But they did!  And they now have a little bundle of joy!  Meet baby Roman!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Like many little newbies, Roman likes to cry, but only when he&apos;s not eating.  But in the sweet moments when Roman was feeling peaceful we were able to capture the obious love this family has!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Rebecca and Mike are naturals and oh so relaxed!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Baby Roman you are so close to perfection it&apos;s scary.  I have a feeling you&apos;re a little heartbreaker in the making!</p>
