<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It&apos;s shocking really. Â We&apos;re halfway through 2011. Â I don&apos;t want to admit that I&apos;m screaming inside for the world to slow down just a bit, because it&apos;s frightening to think about how fast life goes by. Â I guess I&apos;ll use the fear as a reminder to live life to it&apos;s fullest every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So being that it&apos;s July 1st it&apos;s time for me to look at my 5 year goals again. Â I have to admit I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve looked at these since January. Â But they&apos;re up there in my mind, always reminding me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here goes nothing.</p>
<p><strong>1. Photography books</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Nope, nothing come of this yet. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>2. I want to become more active in a charity that helps families that can&apos;t afford high end portraits.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>I found a charity and they are awesome. Â This next half year I&apos;m going to devote more time and energy to the organization.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>3. Â <del>Attend a workshop with a fabulous photog that can help me define my style. Â I&apos;m getting close, but I know I can get closer.</del></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. <del>I&apos;ve been dabbling in all things portrait photography. Â This year I want to push myself to look into other industries. Â I&apos;m really loving fashion photography right now. Â I like to study the lighitng techniques.</del></strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Â I would like to do more travel with my photography. Â Not just for weddings, but for family/kid shoots. Â I think Texas will be my first trip.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Still looking to make this a reality soon!</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>6. Hire my first employee. Â This one scares me, but I&apos;m most excited about it. Â I want someone reliable, but also creative, and supportive.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>I&apos;m ready! Â Time to start having people send resumes. Â I&apos;ve decided I really need someone with a design background that has lots of creative ideas.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>7. Continue to show my Indonesia series around the city, and someday I want to have a gallery opening in NYC!</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. I want to put together a collection of powerful images of kids with handicaps. Â My good friend Karren is going to write their stories, and together we want to help raise awareness for these special kids. Â I also have an idea for a series of pictures about women and their challenges. Â The map has been made now I just need to make it happen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. Â <del>I&apos;m going to get organized with my time, establish some real guidelines for myself and my clients.</del></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>I learned that you have to have a schedule and systems. Â Monday is my fill orders day. Â Tues, Thurs, and Sat are my shoot days, and Friday is my book keeping, and mail day.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>10. Â Still need to do better with follow up. Â I need to show the clients I love and adore how much they mean to me.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>I don&apos;t think this goal will ever go away!</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>11. Read a book that will help me grow professionally every month.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>So far, so good!</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>12. Blog regularly, 3 times a week ideally. Â I also want to get better about blogging about the photography business.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong> Hahah not so much! Â But lately I&apos;ve been blogging daily. Â I just feel off the blog bus for a little second!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So not too bad! Â I still have a ways to go, and already I&apos;m thinking of the ones I&apos;d like to add on. Â ðŸ™‚ Â I guess I can just focus on these for the next 6 months.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Have a wonderful day!</p>
