<p style="text-align: center;">I have to admit, photographing 6 month olds is probably my very favorite. Â At 6 months old our little babies develop happy bubbly personalities. Â And they can&apos;t crawl, which makes my job so much easier. Â ðŸ™‚ Â Little Ben was in a great mood. Â He was all smiles and so much fun to photograph. Â I loved our time together.</p>
